Event 31: S.Cole
this: I'm Cole and I rock this place.
rob3: We've been sent to train with you.
this: So you wanna train with Cole, hey?
this: Fine, here comes the express!
this: I'm burned out.
this: You guys are cool, but you aren't Cole.

Event 23: brightsword2
boy: You're a foolish woman. I don't know why you tried to save me. 
boy: She's not well. She won't last much longer like this. 
boy: Come on, let's get her inside the base.
boy: Ingrid, do you have anything for her?
ing-c: It depends ...
ing-x: What do you want me to turn her into?
boy: We'll have to see if we can get something back in town. 
boy: We should make it a priority. She'll die if we wait too long. 
boy: She won't last much longer.
boy: Looks like she's still breathing.
ing: Did it work?
boy-w: She's awake!
boy: Can you hear me?
boy: How are you feeling?
this: Betrayed ... $w.40 by my own father. $w.30
this: How ...
this: How could he do this?
boy: Looks like you're feeling better. Nice meeting you. 
this: Farewell.
boy: I'm leaving.
this: Very well.
boy: ^Fine!
boy: Let's hear it. What do you want me to do?
this: Excuse me?
boy: You want me to repay you for saving me.
this: I was just doing my duty.
this: I request nothing in return.
boy: No need for the guilt tactics. Just tell me what you want in return. 
this: But if you feel like you owe me something ...
boy-a: Of course I don't!
ing: ^Boyle? $w.20 Are you growing a conscience?
boy-a: No! I just know she's going to try to get something from me. 
boy-a: So she may as well ask now.
this: Help me bring my father to justice. That will be more than enough. 
boy: I can do that.
this: Take this.
this: That is the key to the guard tower just over  there. 
this: If Dad was conspiring with the demons, there must be some sort of clue in his room. 
this: Bring the evidence to me so we can track him down. 
boy: No problem.
this: It's my responsibility to bring my father to justice.
boy: We found an odd key in your father's possessions. 
this: Hmmm, it certainly looks demonic.
this: But it also looks like the keys we use here in the Royal Woods. 
this: He could be using an abandoned house to summon the demons here in the Royal Woods. 
this: If we find this house, maybe we can use it to summon my father. 
boy: But we have no idea where the house is.
this: Yes, that's true ...
this: There's a lot of slime on this key.
this: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
rob: I think we ^might be!
this: Great, I'll meet you there!
mys-c: So?
rob-c: What?
mys: What was she thinking?
rob: She said there was a lot of slime on the key.
rob-h: So naturally, the house will be in a very slimey place! 
mys-w: We know that, but she knew which slimey place it was in! 
rob-c: Why didn't she tell us then?
ing-a: Because you acted like you knew!
boy: I guess we'll have to find it ourselves.

Event 1: rob4
Robin: Albert, help me settle an argument. What sound does a horse make? 
Horse: Neighhh!!!
Robin: I knew it!
Ingrid: Yep, he's our guy.

Event 37: T.House
ing: It's locked.

Event 29: S.Dale
this: So, the stable boy is joining the crusade now?
this: I knew we were short on numbers, but I didn't think the situation was this dire. 
rob-s: I'm sorry.
mys-a: Robin has courage! Why does it matter to you if he fights? 
this: I'm the one who will have to drag his body from the battlefield. 
this: Luckily we still have the tests to keep your kind out. 
rob-a: I'll pass any test you throw at me!
this: Your first test is a sparring session with me.
this: Arm yourself!
this: So you beat an old man. It means nothing.
this: Find and defeat the three trainers in the camp, and we'll consider you worthy enough to die on the  battlefield. 
this: And get yourself some decent armor from the merchant. 
rob-a: Understood!
rob-a: I'll win your respect if it costs me an arm!
this: You show no promise.
rob-a: We defeated all three trainers and earned their badges! 
this: I have no idea how.
this: Fine, you may join. I don't wish to hear more of this. 
ing: We should tell Elizabeth. She'll probably be more impressed. 
this: We don't need to speak again.

Event 5: EV005
mys: So how are we going to convince one of the paladins to join us? 
boy: A good old kidnapping. One of the classics.
ing-h: Ooh, I ^love a good kidnapping.
mys: No! That's what those demons did to my brother!
boy: And it worked out great for them.
boy: That's the thing about kidnappings. They never fail. 
mys: That makes us no different to those demons.
boy: Relax, we only need to get a paladin away from the pack to talk to him. 
boy: We won't force him to do anything against his will. 
mys: ... fine.
ing: Who are we going to kidnap?
boy: Find the weakest looking one so we're not met with too much resistance. 
boy: No need to try to be a hero.

Event 26: EV026
boy: There are paladins that way.
ing: So what?
boy-w: Do you have a death wish?
boy: We can't well kidnap a paladin by going through the front entrance. 

Event 28: EV028
this: Prize

Event 4: S.Elizabeth Brightsword
this: Begone evil beings!
boy: Fine, fine. We were just leaving.
boy3: Alright, try not to take too long. I don't have all day. 
ing3: What are you talking about? You're not coming?
boy3: That place is crawling with paladins.
boy3: It wouldn't be smart for me to go in there. What if one of them gets me in a bad mood? 
mys3-s: Boyle ...
mys3-h: You're not $w.45 ^scared $w.45 are you?
boy3-a: Of course not!
ing3-x: Ah ha ha ha ha!
this: Begone evil beings!
ing3: Relax, we're just here to join the crusade.
this: Evil beings in my crusade? I won't allow it!
ing3-a: We're good now!$w.45 And only two of us were even evil to begin with. 
boy3: Well, one, if you're going by success.
ing3: Look, we've got a paladin.
rob3-w: Ouch!
rob3-s: Oh ...
rob3-h: Pleasure to meet you! I'm Robin!
this: I know who you are, fool. You're the stable boy.
this: Why aren't you tending to the horses?
rob3-s: Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I'll get to that right away.
mys3: ^Hold ^it!
mys3: Robin, come back.
mys3-a: Robin is a ^paladin now. He no longer tends to the stables. 
this: Hmmm ...
this: You know, he ^does seem different now.
this: Very well, Robin. Nice to have you on board. Are these your friends? 
rob3: The ladies are. I only have a minion-master relationship with Boyle. 
this: Fine, the ladies may join. The male can be gone.
boy3: Fine by me!
rob3: Please let him come with us!
rob3-s: He took me from a lowly stable boy to a paladin. I owe him everything. 
this: Only paladins and friends of paladins may join the crusade. 
this: So is he your friend or your master?
boy3-s: Fine, he's my friend.
rob3-h: I knew I'd earn your respect eventually, Boyle! 
boy3: Let's not dwell on it.
this: Congratulations, you're all now part of the crusade. 
rob3: Now let's go fight some demons!
this: Not so fast. I can't sign just anybody up for war. 
this: It's my duty to make sure the men and women I send are both willing and able. 
this: So ... $w.60 are you ^willing?
rob3: ... yes.
this: Good. You're willing, we're half way there. But are you $w.30 ^able? 
rob3: Yes.
this: That part's not quite so easy. 
this: You'll have to pass the tests first. Report to Dale.
this: Keep in mind, the tests were designed for paladins. 
boy3: Oh good, so they'll be easy.
this: ^Silence! $w.45 It would be a shame to have to cut off such a quick tongue. 
this: Some might describe Dale's attitude as salty, so just be forewarned. 
this: Did you fail the tests yet?
boy3: No!
this: Quiet, you!
rob: We've finished all of the tests!
this: Very good, Robin. I'm impressed with your progress. 
this: In ^and out of the stables.
rob: So when do we leave for the crusades?
this: Not for a while. We're still a bit short on numbers. 
boy3: We don't have time to sit around waiting. Let's just leave now. 
this: You sound like Dale. We can't show up with a half-full ship, the demons will see it as a sign of  weakness. 
rob: I don't understand, everybody should be chomping at the bit to go on a crusade like this! 
this: I tell you what, the king keeps a list of the registered fighers in the kingdom. 
this: Many still haven't shown up.
this: Get his list and convince three more men to join and we can set off on our crusade. 
rob: We'll be back before you know it!
boy3: You really think you can convince three men to join a pointless crusade in such a short time? 
rob: I can be very presuasive.
this: Convince three more men to join and we can leave. 
rob: Good news, we've recruited all of the men!
this: I'm impressed.
this: You've come a long way since your humble beginnings as a stable boy. 
rob-h: Thank you! You don't know how much that means to me! 
boy3: He was better as a stable boy if you ask me.
this: Are you coming, or waiting over there?
boy3-a: Of course I'm coming!
boy3: ^Somebody has to save the world, and I know you paladins aren't going to be the ones to do it. 
this: Well, you'd better come inside if you want to come with us. 
boy3-w: I'll wait until you're on the boats, thanks.
this: Fine, have it your way.

Event 3: EV003
boy: This leads into the paladin base! We're not going in there! 
boy: Look. Over there!
boy: One of the paladins has strayed from the pack. He appears vulnerable. 
mys-c: Should we go?
boy: Not yet ... he could be powerful.
rob4: Albert, help me settle an argument. What sound does a horse make? 
Albert: Neighhh!!!
rob4-h: I knew it!
ing: Yep, he's our guy.
boy: Listen closely ... here's what we're going to do.
rob4: All done! All the animals have been locked away. 
rob4-h: Time to relax!
rob4-c: How did you get out?
rob4-h: Come on, let's get you inside.
mf: Growl.
rob4-w: ^Arrghhh!!!
ing5: Exactly to plan!
boy: No need to go back in there.

Event 32: S.Storm
this: You shouldn't speak to me, didn't you hear the Storm warning? 
this: Batten down the hatches because there's a Storm coming. 
this: Nobody has ever $w.30 weathered the Storm.
this: I promised myself $w.30 I wasn't going to $w.30 ^Storm ^off! 
this: Now I'm just a light shower.

Event 21: EV021
ing2: Wake up, Boyle.
ing2: WAKE.
ing2: UP!
boy2-w: !!!
ing2: Finally, he heard me.
boy2-a: Argh! Ingrid! Why would you wake me up!
boy2-s: I was having the most ^wonderful dream!
mys2: Poor Boyle, we you having a nightmare again?
boy2: No ... for once I wasn't.
boy2-c: Wait, how did we get back here?
rob2-h: We fought valiantly, but ultimately we were defeated. 
ing2-s: Yes, it wasn't our best effort.
mys2: The paladins were not as fearless as expected. 
boy2: Yes, I remember now. They all abandoned us.
mys2: Except for one.
boy2: But how did we get back here? We were surrounded by demons. 
mys2: I've no idea. Something must have brought us back to the boat. 
rob2: So shall we head back for another round?
ing2: I don't think we're going back anytime soonn.
rob2-w: The boats!
boy2: Never mind the boats, we have a new quest.
boy2: A man came to me in my dreams. He can fix my crippling nightmares if we find him. 
boy2: He left me with a clue ...
ing2: Are you still dizzy, Boyle?
boy2: He told me there's a secret passage somewhere in the Royal Castle. 
rob2: Sounds like fun! I've always dreamed about what might be under that castle! 
ing2: Come on, you guys don't really believe this do you? 
mys2: How do we find the entrance?
boy2: If I'm to save the world, I'll need all of my wits about me. 
boy2: I'll search that town high and low if it means I don't have to dream about demons anymore. 
mys2: Boyle. Aren't you forgetting something?
boy2-c: What?
mys2: She risked her life to save you.
boy2: ...

Event 30: S.Marsh
this: I have much to teach. But are you willing to learn? 
rob3: Trainer Marsh!
this: You show no promise.
this: Good job.

Event 3: EV003
1: ^Ingrid! You came to visit me!?
1: I've missed you ^so ^much! What have you been doing? 
ing2: Hello, sister.
1: I don't know how this is possible, but your beauty has grown since even the last time I saw you. 
1: What wicked concoctions have you been imbibing? 
ing2-a: That's none of your business!
1: Sorry, Ingrid.
boy2: I suppose this one is your ^younger sister, then? 
rob2-s: I wish I had a younger brother.
rob2-a: I'd teach him so many things and look after him when nan went to market! 
1: Look Ingrid, I I laid out my house ^just like yours!
ing2-a: Yes, I noticed ...
ing2: Tell me, sister, did you put a curse on the carpenter at the end of the world? 
1: Hee hee.
ing2: I'll take that as a yes.
1: He's ^sooooooooooo talented!
1: He made all of my furniture EXACTLY like yours!
1: I wanted to see how good he was, so I shrunk down his family so he would have to make them tiny  furniture. 
1: And he did it! Hee hee!
ing2-a: You did a bad thing, sister. A very bad thing.
ing2: Now you need to undo it.
1: Ummm ...
1: How?
ing2: You created the curse, you should know.
1: Hilgrid always helped me with my counter-curses ... 
ing2: You mean you can't get rid of it?
1: I'm sorry, Ingrid! Please forgive me.
1: Maybe if you helped me ...
1: We could do it together?
ing2: How would that work?
1: Well, when I made the curse in the first place, I had to get a tiny lizard from the Dragon Wasteland. 
1: A man came over, and he kept bugging me for the lizard. 
1: He said he was capable of creating any recipe I might be able to dream up. 
1: He was also a weakling, so he couldn't gather the ingredients himself. 
1: I told him it was too important, so he couldn't have it. 
ing2-w: You think he was telling the truth?
1: I could tell he was smart. $w.30 Like you!
ing2: I suppose it could work.
ing2-x: And if he's lying, we can always have fun cursing him! 
1: You'll have to help me get the tiny lizard. I'll meet you in the Dragon Wasteland. 
1: They hang around this big pile of old bones.
1: I'll meet you there.
boy: Well she's a lot more pleasant than you are, Ingrid. 
ing: And yet ^I'm the one you're marrying.

Event 1: S.Grenhilda
this: Ingriiiiiiiiiid!

Event 3: S.Galahad
this: This place gives me the creeps.
this: Please take me to my wife quickly.
rob: Follow me!
rob: Go ahead.
4: Galahad! What a surprise!
4: How did you find me?
3: I travelled far and fought countless demons to find you, wife. 
3: All so I could tell you that our marriage is over!
3: I will no longer be your husband!
4: You came all this way just to tell me that?
4: I don't know what to say.
4: You must be ^incredibly tired!
3: You know ... I ^really am.
4: Why don't you come inside and rest?
3: That doesn't sound like a bad idea.
4: Come on, I'll prepare your bed.
vn-rob: They appear to have a similar dynamic to Boyle and Ingrid. 
vn-ing: And it appears to be working just fine for them. 
vn-hib-x: I should probably check if he's sleeping alright. 
vn-ing-a: !!!
vn-hib-w: Or not!

Event 6: EV006
phy: Bahl has put up barriers around the town.
phy: The purple ones are being chanelled by the mages, so we'll have to defeat them to get through. 
rob: And what about the red ones?
phy: The red ones are made of tacky demon magic.
phy2: Let's go!

Event 15: U
boy: We're blocked.

Event 4: Grothilda
this: Tell me when you gotta spoon.
ing: I've got it.
this: And here is the cure.
this: And here are my crafts.
ing: Unlike your crafts, your enslavement curse is really impressive. You should stick to that. 
this: But I have. Do you think these girls joined my coven of their own free will? 
ing-w: You mean ... they're ^all cursed?
this: Not anymore.
this: The curses wore off, but the love of crafting remained. 
this: If you like, you can join my coven and learn a few enslavement spells of your own. 
this: ^And you can join our crafting sessions!
ing: I'll think about it. But crafting is definitely out of the question. 
this: Thought about my offer?

Event 2: EV002
4: Oh, it's you.
ing2: As sociable as ever, I see.
4: Leave me alone, Ingrid, I just want to do my crafts in peace. 
ing2-c: You'vestarted that forsaken crafting again?
ing2-a: How many times did mother tell you that you have no talent? 
4: More than enough.
4: Leave me alone, Ingrid, I'm running a successful crafting coven here. 
ing2: Obviously not successful enough to stop you from selling curses. 
4: What are you talking about?
ing2: You've cursed one of the elves to be under the control of a mystic. 
ing2: And don't even try to deny it or I'll turn you into something even more unsightly than you already are. 
4: Fine, I do the odd curse here and there. But who doesn't? 
ing2: I need you to remove it.
4: Sorry, I can't do that. The mystic pays me good money each month to prolong the curse. 
4: I guess he doesn't realize that the curse is already permanent. 
ing2: ...
ing2: I admit, it's a pretty good scheme you've got going, but I require the elf to do my own bidding. 
4: I need that money. My crafting business isn't exactly profitable yet. 
ing2: ...
ing2-s: Fine.
ing2: You're myst sister, so it really pains me to do this, but I have a shop in Tor. 
ing2: I suppose I could sell some of your crafts there.
4: You'd do that for me?
ing2: I'll sell  them, but I can't promise you anybody will buy them. 
ing2: After all, they're disgusting. Mother was right, you really have no talent. 
4: Thank you, Ingrid. All I ever wanted was a chance.
4: Here is the recipe for the antidote. 
4: Here, you'll need this too.
4: We use a trap to keep our moon tears safe in the divisive thicket.

mys: Here tis.

Event 19: EV019
rob3: And that was the most yoghurt I ever ate.
mys3: Come on Robin, time to  go.
mys3: I got you a present.
rob3-h: The list of paladins! Boyle is going to be so impressed with you! 
mys3: Let's tell him you found it.
rob3: Really? You'd let me take credit for this?
mys3: You did the hard part. Come on, let's go.

Event 9: EV009
boy2: Here she is. Well, go ahead and fix her.
ing2: I can't.
boy2-w: What do you mean you can't!?
ing2: I didn't curse her. Why would I have the cure?
boy2-w: What!? What are we supposed to do then?
ing2: You tell  me. You're the one who volunteered to fix her. 
boy2-a: Why didn't you stop me if you couldn't do anything? 
ing2-h: I can turn her into a frog if you like.
boy2: Would that wake her up?
ing2: No ... do you know anything about curses?
boy2-w: Myst? Do you have any ideas?
mys2: ...
mys2: I could envelop her in mist ...
boy2-c: And would that help?
mys2-h: No. Hee hee.
ing2-h: I'm starting to like you.
boy2-a: This isn't funny. Our necks are on the line here. 
boy2: You'll be going straight to the gallows if we fail this. 
ing2-h: I'd like to see them try.
ing2: Fine, your desperation is starting to annoy me.  
ing2: I need you to retain ^some credibility if you're going to be my husband one day. 
ing2: This looks like the work of my sister. She lives in these parts, after all.  
ing2: She simply needs to be kissed by her paladin lover and she'll wake up. 
Guard: That could be a problem. Her prince charming  went missing two weeks ago. Nobody has seen him  since. 
ing2: And how long has she been cursed for?
Guard: Two weeks ...
ing2: If my sister cast the curse like I think, she'll know the whereabouts of the prince. 
ing2: She lives in the North Royal Woods.

Event 1: S.King
boy4: Hello king.
this: For the last time, I said ^no ^visitors!
boy4: But we brought you a very elegant frame from the market. 
this: My daughter is in peril! She could die!
this: Do you really think my attention could be taken by shiny objects at a time like this? 
this: ...
this: Fine, let me see it ...
this: ...
this: Okay ... it's pretty nice. I will hear what you have to say. 
this: But understand I'm very distraught! My daughter is the most important thing in the world to me, and I  will not - 
this: ^Hey! That's a nice necklace you've got there.
mys4-h: Oh, thank you very much!
this: Are you looking to sell it?
mys4-s: I'm sorry, I can't part with it ...
this: Ahhh, sentimental value, hey? I understand. I have this really nice rose girdle ... 
ing4: So you were saying something about your daughter! 
this: My what? $w.30 Oh, yes, of course. My prized possession. My life. My everything. She is all I have  in this world.  
this: She has been ... oh, I can't even say it -
this: That ^is a very nice ring you've got there ...
this: ^CURSED! $w.25 My own daughter! From  morning til night, I think of nothing but her. 
this: I am not fit to serve as king so long as she is like this! 
this: I am in such a state of despair I've even considered stepping down just so I may spend more  time looking for a cure! 
this: The worst part of it ... there is something I wanted to say to her, but never got the chance. 
this: If I could just speak to her ... even for asecond ... I could move on. 
mys4: How touching. You love her as you would a four-legs. 
this: How ^dare you!?
ing4-x: Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
ing4: Careful, Myst, not everybody loves their pets as much as Boyle. 
this: I cannot bear the pain any longer! I live every day with regret at not saying what I wanted to say  sooner. 
boy4: We have a witch here who specializes in curses. Perhaps she could help ... 
this: A ^what!? You mean to tell me I have allowed a witch in ^my keep? 
this: I don't know whether to smite you or kiss you!
ing4-a: I don't recommend either.
this: You're in luck. On any other day I'd have sent you off to the gallows by now. 
this: But if you can cure my daughter, I may offer you a repreive. 
ing4: How generous of you.
boy4: We don't work for free. If we do this for you, we want a boat. 
this: A boat for my daughter's life? That's ^unreasonable!  
this: But I'll arrange for you to be dropped off anywhere you like. 
boy4: That will have to do.
this: She's upstairs somewhere if you'd like to take a look at her. I never can seem to remember which  room is hers. 
this: She's upstairs somewhere if you'd like to take a look at her. I never can seem to remember which  room is hers. 
this: Do you come bearing news of my daughter?
ing: Indeed, we've discovered the way to fix her, but we require a paladin. 
this: A paladin ... this could prove troublesome.
ing: You're the king. I figured you would have plenty at your disposal. 
this: Normally ... yes. But they're preparing for a crusade at the moment.  
this: I can't really pull them back. What would that look like? 
ing-a: Your daughter's life is at risk!
this: I'm sure you'll fix her. Unless you'd rather go to the gallows? 
this: I know what I'd choose.
ing: I guess we'll have to go and get one ourselves.
boy-w: An entire army of paladins? I think we should steer clear of that. 
ing: It'll be okay, Boyle. We only need one. You're not scared, are you? 
boy-a: Of course not!
mys: How will we convince him to help us?
boy-h: Don't worry, I've got an idea ...
boy: Let's head to the camp, I'll tell you when we get there. 
this: Do you come bearing news of my daughter?
this: Betrayed by my own daughter. What kind of a king am I? 
ing: An obnoxious one.
boy: So, as for our reward ...
this: Oh, of course. I hereby grant you free access to the trade boats that travel between here and Tor. Use  them as you like. 
mys: That's handy!
boy-a: We don't need to travel to Tor! We need to travel to the Shadow Lands. 
this: I'm not sending my trade ships there! That's crazy talk. 
boy-a: We had a deal!
this: You know what ...
this: The paladins are planning a crusade on the Shadaow Lands. If you really want to go, why don't  you sign up? 
boy-a: You want me to team up with those bloodthirsty devils? You've lost your mind! We will  not! 
ing: Boyle, that's actually not a bad idea. It's a free trip to the Shadow Lands. 
boy: I doubt we'd even make it there with those cretins helming the ship. 
boy: We'd be tossed overboard before we even left the port. 
ing: We have the king's approval. They won't do anything to us. 
rob: Do you mind if I come along? It's kind of my dream to join a crusade. 
boy-a: Absolutely not. We're done with you.
rob: Okay, maybe some other time.
mys-a: Hold it!
mys: This boy radiates a strange purity unlike the rest of the men in this land. 
boy: I knew there was a reason I didn't like him.
mys: I want him to come with us.
ing-h: If it causes Boyle more grief, I'm all for it.
boy-a: That seems to the only thing you consider when inviting people to join us! 
rob-h: Perfect! Let's go join that crusade!
rob: I've always wanted to say that.
this: ^Hold ^it!
this: One more thing ...
this: I am smitten with your witch.
ing-a: Oh, please.
this: And at the risking of sounding weak ... $w.30 I'D GIVE UP ANYTHING FOR HER! 
ing: Please don't do this.
this: Even my own daughter!!
ing: I couldn't respect a man who would give up his own daughter for anything. 
ing: And I'm pretty sure you'd give her up for just that. ^Anything. 
this: She speaks so honestly! She is truly a catch.
this: She will be my most prized possession!!!
this: I will place her in my trophy room alongisde my golden chalice! 
boy: I'm going to have to stop you there. Not because I don't want to be rid of her - of course I do. 
boy: Sadly she is busy helping us save the world. As a king, you probably understand that. 
this: Let the world burn, I say! And even then, it would not burn as bright as my love for her! 
this: Don't worry, I will offer you fair recompense for her. How does a silk mattress sound? 
boy: Like more than she is worth, but sadly we still need her. 
ing-a: Gee, thanks for sticking up for me, future husband! 
this: Betrayed by my own daughter. What kind of a king am I? 

Event 47: T.Office
mys: I need the list.

Event 12: EV012
1: Ahhh, you've returned!
1: But ... where is that most enchanting enchantress? 
rob3: She's hiding out  in the foyer.I  think she's scared of you. 
1: I $w.30 ^scare her? $w.30 She scares ^me. In the best way possible. Can you tell her that? 
rob3: Sure.
1: So, so what do I owe the pleasure?
rob3-c: Good question ... I think we wanted to register some paladins. 
1: ^Register ^some ^paladins?
rob3-c: No ... that's not right.
rob3-s: Argh! I did it again. I got so caught in my excitement that I stopped listening. 
mys3: Shall we go and ask again?
rob3: If we do that I'll never earn Boyle's respect.
rob3: Look, we're trying to find some paladins to join the crusade. 
1: Ah, so you probably want some kind of  list of registered paladins. 
rob3-h: Yes, that's it! Do you have one?
1: Wouldn't be much of a king if I didn't. By why should I give it to you? 
rob3: Because we're starting a crusade!
1: Crusades are very bad for a king. I stand to lose a lot of good men. The only point in doing them is to  keep up appearances. 
rob3: What about glory? Pride? Vengeance?
1: Worthless.
rob3: Come on, you have to help me, my reputation is riding on this! 
mys3: Robin ... a word?
mys3: He's not going to give it up, we'll have to do something else. 
rob3: ...
rob3: Shall we kidnap him?
mys3: I don't think kidnapping is a good idea in this case. There are a lot of guards around. 
mys3: Robin, I have an idea. Can you stay here and keep him distracted for a while? 
rob3: Sure, what are you going to do?
mys3: Don't you worry. Just keep him distracted.

Event 11: EV011
boy2: Alright, Robin. You're up.
rob2: Forgive me princess, but I'm doing this for you.
rob2: Kiss kiss.
rob2-w: She's awake!
rob2-h: I'm a real paladin!
18: My daughter! You are awake once more!
4: Father ... is that you?
18: My daughter, I have waited too long to speak these words to you! 
18: ^No ^more! From now on I will speak my feelings!
4: Hold nothing back father, I have been waiting for this for too long. 
18: Where did you put my lavish jewels? I've been looking for them everywhere! 
4: ^That is what you wanted to tell me?
18: I have thought of nothing else for the past twenty nights while you were cursed! I've been worried sick! 
18: Those jewels mean everything to me.
18: Speak quickly, lest you fall back into another deep sleep and take the location of the jewels with you! 
4: I ^cannot believe you!
4: $s.2 You are the $s.1 WORST $s.2 father ever! $s.3 
18: $s.3 I don't have time for your tantrums, Jewel.
18: We may not have long together, let's make the seconds we do have count. 
4: Fine, I'll tell you where the jewels are! I gave them to my ^boyfriend! 
4: Speaking of which, where is that man? Why didn't ^he wake me from my curse? 
18: Because you drove him to madness with that attitude of yours!  
18: He'd rather be a frog than put up with you any longer, and I can't say I blame him! 
18: Now you have no need for the jewels, so give them back! 
4: If you didn't want to lose them, you never should have challenged me to two card flip! 
18: I shouldn't have had to! Your mother's scarf should have been mine to begin with! 
18: That ^does it! I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU ANYMORE!!! 
4: FINE! I'm not talking to ^you anymore either!
4: Tell me ... is it true what my father says? Is my beloved a frog? 
rob2-s: I'm sorry. I'm sure you'll find somebody else.
4: ^No!
4: I'm not ready to give up yet. I've already invested too much time and effort into him! 
4: I gave him my father's ^favorite gems!
4: I had him dishonorably discharged from the crusade. 
4: I had his betrothed shipped off to Tor under false pretenses ... 
4: I even had him spend three weeks in ^prison!
4: I won't lie here and see all of my efforts ^wasted!
rob2-c: Perhaps if I kidnapped him for you ...
4: Yes!
4: And I'll pretend to be asleep.
4: When he gets here, we'll do the whole thing again!
boy2: I want no part in this.
ing2: It's sweet!
boy2: No man should be forced to marry against his will. 
ing2: That's just the curse talking.
4: My father is very wealthy, and not great at protecting his assets. Perhaps we can work  something out. 
boy2: Maybe ...
boy2: For now, I'd like to speak to the king again. He owes us a boat. 

Event 3: S.Guard2
this: The princess is not fit for visitors at this time.

Event 10: EV010
boy2: Okay, Robin. As you can see, the princess has been cursed. A kiss from a paladin will wake her up,  so have at it. 
rob2: Ummm ...
rob2-c: Are we sure that's a good idea? I mean, have you considered any alternative treatments? 
boy2: Yes, we already tried them. What's the problem? 
rob2-w: I mean ... well, ummm, it's too forward, don't you think? 
boy2: I'm sure she'll forgive you, given the circumstances. 
rob2: Okay, I guess. Here goes ...
rob2: Kiss kiss.
boy2-c: Is she awake?
ing2: Nope.
boy2-a: Try again!
rob2: Kiss kiss.
ing2: Still not working.
rob2: Okay, one more try.
rob2: Kiss kiss.
ing2: That's enough. It's clearly not working.
boy2: It makes no sense. We brought a paladin!
boy2-c: Robin?
rob2-w: ...eh?
boy2-a: You ^are a paladin, right?
rob2-w: Heh ... I mean, probably ...
rob2: After all, what does being a paladin actually mean? 
rob2: Sure, I may or may not be a paladin in an official capacity, but it's not as if I don't possess the  classic traits. 
rob2: I'm courteous. I'm punctual ... honest -
boy2-a: So you lied to me!? After I spent all that time and energy kidnapping you? 
rob2-w: No! I'm so sorry! It wasn't a waste! I promise!
rob2-s: It's just ... I thought we'd go and fight some demons or something ... or deliver some goods. 
rob2-s: How was I supposed to know we'd start with this? 
boy2: You've failed as a paladin, and worse, you've failed as a minion. Now we have to go and kidnap  another one. 
ing2: Hold it.
ing2: Boyle, I think I might have an idea.
ing2: Robin, allow us to talk in private for a moment.
rob2: Okay. Just promise you won't go anywhere without me. 
ing2: He's not a paladin, but  all may not yet be lost.
ing2: He only has to ^think he's a paladin for this to work. So all we have to do is convince him. 
mys2: It seems a poor idea to convince him that he is something he's not. 
mys2: That sounds like it will only lead to bad things for him later in life. 
ing2: But it helps us right now, and it's actually rather simple. 
ing2: All we have to do is  make a fake trial for him. 
ing2: We'll take him into the Cleansing Caves in the woods, then I'll summon a fake spirit. 
ing2: When he defeats it, he'll think he's a paladin.
boy2: It sounds good to me, but so has everything else up until this point. 
ing2: The main requirement is that the subject is open to suggestion. In that regard, we've hit the jackpot. 
boy2: I think you're forgetting one thing.
ing2: And what is that?
boy2: You're a lousy witch. You can't summon a spirit. 
ing2-a: ^Excuse me!? $w.30 My knowledge and curses are the only thing that have gotten us ^this  far! 
boy2: I was just going to suggest we use a summoning scroll. 
boy2: I've seen a few scary types around this town. This would be the place to get one. 
ing2: ...
ing2: Send Robin back in.
ing2: Good news, Robin. We're going to give you the chance to become a real paladin. 
ing2: But you'll need to pass a very difficult trial first. Think you're up to it? 
rob2-h: You bet!
ing2: Great. Then let us head to the cleansing caves.

Event 21: EV021
mys5: This must be where he keeps the list.

Event 53: U.SecretDungeon
boy-c: Why is this piece of wall framed with a doorway? 
ing: Who knows? Maybe there used to be a door there. 
boy: Yes ... ^used to.

boy-h: I knew it!

1: New fighters, or spirited spectators?
boy: I understand you have my dog.
1: You mean the storm wolf that was brought in earlier? 
1: He's the grand prize in the beginners tournament.  
boy-a: He's not a prize! I'm taking him back.
1: You don't have to convince me. Go show the people in the arena. 
boy-a: Fine, I'll take on all contenders!
1: The beginners tournament takes place in the red arena. 
1: Good luck, you'll likely win. We don't have any requirements to enter so we get all sorts. 
1: My grandma accidentally wandered in there one day when she forgot to wear her glasses. 
1: She finished third.
1: Battlegrounds access is to your right.
1: To your left, the spectators entrance.

this: I'd pay you ^dearly for that thing!
this: Please, I ^must have it.
sys: Gabriella's fangs begin to emerge as she fawns over the doll. 
boy-w: Okay, okay, take it!
this: Thank you so much!

mys2-h: Is he your new best friend then?
boy-a: How dare you insult mine and Fang's friendship!? 
boy: Colby is a minion, nothing more!
boy: I won't be showing him a ^single ounce of affection! 
mys2: You named him. That suggests affection amongst your kind, doesn't it? 
boy: Of course not! For example, I might call you ^incredibly ^annoying ^pest. 
boy: That wouldn't make us friends, would it?
mys2: Just call me Myst. It will save time in the future.
boy-c: In the ^future? What does that mean?
mys2-h: I'm coming with you!
boy: You are ^most ^certainly ^not.
mys2: Mother sent me to watch you.
boy: I've got Colby, I don't need any more minions. 
mys2: I'm to help you find my brother.
boy: Tell your mother, thanks for the offer, but I'm fine. 
boy: Besides, you're a creature of the mist. You'd shrivel up in the real world. 
mys2: Mother gave me her pendant. I can go anywhere a normal man can go. 
boy: I'm not going to waste time arguing. If you're going to follow me, do it silently. 

Event 2: EV002
boy-s: Nobody appreciates me.

boy: Alright, I guess we're supposed to fill the bucket with water. 
rob: Fascinating! I feel like we should make a wish or something. 
rob: My nan says a little man lives at the bottom of every well. 
boy-s: You haven't had many good male role models in your life, have you Robin? 
rob-s: My nan tried to raise me to be the best man she could. 
boy: That's okay, I never had any male role models either. 
rob: Who taught you your leadership qualities?
boy: Well, it certainly wasn't my nan.
rob: Nan believes children should be quiet and submissive. 
boy: Robin, if you ever want to be taken seriously, you've got to stop listening to your nan. 
rob-s: I don't know if nan would approve ...
boy: Listening to your nan is probably what made you a stable boy. 
rob-a: Nan said all powerful figures started off as stable boys! 
boy: It seems your nan has a warped view of reality.
boy: From now on, consider ^me your nan.
rob-w: You!?
rob-c: I don't know, Boyle, those are some pretty big shoes to fill. 
rob: But you're right. I do want to be more like you.
rob: Thanks for looking out for me!
boy: Well, I have to pass on my wisdom to somebody.
boy: Let's keep this between us.
rob-h: Of course!
boy: Oh look, the bucket has returned. Let's take it back.

1: Hold on, hold on!

rob-c: Did she say anything back?

1: Come say hi to my son.
1: This is my son.
1: As you can tell, he is very much awake!
boy-s: Yes, of course ...
boy: So, I was wondering if you could make me some furniture. 
1: I'd love to.
1: Let's talk inside. I'll have my wife make us drinks.
1: Oh ...
boy: What's wrong?
1: There is no water left ...
1: Would you mind taking my son up to the well to fetch some water? 
1: He's rather good at it. You shouldn't have much trouble. 
boy: Yes, well he looks water tight ...
1: What?
boy: Never mind.
1: Why don't you ladies come inside while the lads head up to the well.

6: ^Why did you ^go and ^get wet!?
boy-w: Was he not supposed to be put in the well?
6: Of course not!

mys-a: My brother! We must go to him.
boy: Stay away from the mirror, Myst.
mys: Why? He needs me!
boy: Ingrid and I can't use magic mirriors. We're ^villains. It's part of the protection on them. 
mys: I can go alone ...
boy: And give Hercules the chance to present two mist wraiths to his demon? You need us. We need to  find another way. 
mys: What are we to do then?
boy: I recognize the place. It’s a common location for villains to open demon portals. It’s called Skull  Mountain, and it’s found in the Shadow Isles. 
boy: There’s no easy way to get there, but I think we can make it before the next blood moon rises. 
boy: We need to return to themainland and take a ship to the Shadow Isles. 
boy: We can depart from the city of Tor, south of Windshire. 
ing: Alright, let's head back that way.
mys: To the ferry!
boy-s: ...
ing-s: ... ummm.
mys-c: What?
ing: The ferry is out.
mys-a: What do you mean ^out?
boy: There were complications on the way over.
ing: Maybe we can still salvage it.

Event 1: U.Aveyonder
ing: What's this supposed to be?
boy-h: It's kind of like a treasure chest.
ing-c: Are you sure that's a good idea? 
boy: How could it be a bad idea?
ing: We're in a holy place ... we're pushing our luck just being here. 
ing: Everybody knows how vengeful and traditional holy beings can be. 
boy-e: What are they going to do, cast a prayer on me? Ha ha ha! 
ing-e: HA HA HA HA HA HA HA.
Nymph: Thief of Aveyond - be blessed!
boy-a: ^Hey! $w.60 What did you just do to me?
Nymph: As punishment for stealing from the goddess's sacred coffers, I ^blessed you to have  bad luck for seven years. 
ing: That sounds more like a curse to me.
Nymph: We don't use that word around here. We are not villains. We bestow blessings, not curses. 
boy: I can't have bad luck for seven years! How am I going to play two-card flip with no luck? 
ing: You never won before you were cursed, so I don't imagine it will make much of a difference. 
boy-a: Nymph, I demand you uncurse me right now! Or face my wrath! 
Nymph: Don't take that tone with me, I'm protected by the goddess so long as I'm in Aveyond. Your threats  are useless here. 
boy-h: Oh really? Is that what you think?
boy: But what if I was to ...
boy-s: Beg?
Nymph: I can't ^unbless you. I can only apply the blessings. 
Nymph: The only way to remove the blessing  would be to pay back the gold you stole ... 
boy: Well that doesn't seem too-
Nymph: To ^ten ^different^ ^donation ^boxes.
boy-s: What!? But there aren't even that many on this continent. 
Nymph: Then I suppose you'll have to seek other continents.  
Nymph: Or we could two-card flip for it. But given your predicament, I don't think that's a good idea. Ha  ha. 
boy: You're quite malicious for a holy creature.
Nymph: Return to me once you've made donations to the ten statues, and I'll try to unbless you. 

Event 6: EV006
boy: Oracle! Can we speak privately?
boy-a: The fate of the world is at stake!
boy-c: I know we're not wanted here but I wasn't  expecting ^this. 
mys: Boyle, she's cold.
boy-a: You don't have to tell ^me that!
ing: She's been turned to into a statue, Boyle.
boy-w: What!?
boy: Well that explains her stony demeanor.
ing: Somebody must have cursed her.
boy: In Aveyond? Impossible! People of ill-intent cannot enter this sacred place. 
Hercules: Boyle the Horrible?
Hercules: Step away from the villain, fair folk, I shall slay him for you! 
mys2: You are mistaken, we are with him. And he's a ^retired villain. 
ing2: What are you doing here, Hercules? Why is the oracle frozen in stone? 
Hercules: Oh, were you here to see her? I turned her to stone. 
ing2: ^You turned her to stone? Aren't you supposed to be on here side? 
Hercules: We had a disagreement.
ing2: Well, turn her back. We need to talk to her.
Hercules: I'm sorry, I cannot do this ... at least not yet.
boy2: Why?
Hercules: Speak not to me, villain! I do not associate with your type! 
boy2: ...
ing2: ...
mys2: ...
ing2: Why have you done this to the oracle?
Hercules: She wouldn't let me use her magic mirror.
mys2: What use does a fair knight have for a magic mirror? 
Hercules: It's a long story.
mys2: Oh, please tell me! I love long stories. Even where I come from, we have heard of the stories of  the brave Hercules. 
Hercules: You honor me. Okay, I shall tell you the story. 
Hercules: About a fortnight ago, I was on a quest in the Underworld to free a group of villagers captured  by some vampires. 
Hercules: I infiltrated the vampires and indulged in a game of cards. I lost a hand and the vampire took my  gift of charm as payment. 
Hercules: A ^friend offered to help me restore my gift, and I obliged. I simply needed to bring him a mist  wraith before the next blood moon. 
Hercules: I captured a small one to give to my friend. Shortly afterward, the Oracle summoned me here  and demanded I return the mist wraith to its home. 
Hercules: I did not agree. The Oracle does not understand how important my gift of charm is to my  work as a hero. 
Hercules: She became irate, so I turned her to stone with my stone amulet.  
mys2-a: You ^stole ^my ^brother!?
boy2: Calm down, Myst, we’ll get to the bottom of this. 
boy2: Hercules, let me guess ... your friend is a demon. 
Hercules: Well, yes, but he's a good demon.
boy2: There are no good demons you fool! And they always lie. Ask any failed villain. 
Hercules: You lie, foul creature! Do not speak of my friend this way. His word is good.  
ing2: Hercules, we demand that you return the child that you stole. His mother is causing great chaos that  is affecting the good folk you say you represent. 
Hercules: I’m tired of listening to your lies. I have work to do. I will deal with you later, villain.  
mys2: My poor brother! He’s only a baby ... I thought Hercules was supposed to be a hero. 
ing2: You have a lot to learn about the “good” side, child. 
mys2: He spoke of a blood moon. And it sounded like he still has my brother alive somewhere. 
boy2: The Blood Moon is day when villains attempt to draw demons into this world. It only occurs once  every six years. 
mys2: What does this have to do with ^my brother?
boy2: The demon needs a host to survive in this world.  
mys2-s: No ...
boy2: Don't worry, we'll find your brother, and I'll get back my dog before it's too late. 
ing2: And we'll save the world from a hero. How ironic. 
mys2: What about the Oracle?
boy2: She looks good as a statue ...
mys2: Boyle!
boy2: Let's search Aveyond. Perhaps we can find clues to the whereabouts of your brother.

Event 92: SJudy6
this: If anybody makes it out, they know they'll have me to deal with. 
this: That's probably why noboy has ever escaped.

Event 15: EV015
Haaf: You saved us from death, friend. What can we do to repay you? 
boy: Passage across the river is all I request.
boy: And a little recognition.
Melvor: All hail Boyle the Brave! Defender of the weak! Representative of the $w.45 brave! 
boy: It's nice to finally get some recognition.
5: ^HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLD ^IT!!!
boy-h: And then, in a rare public display of power, I set upon the king and slew him with a single blow! 
14: Wooooow! You must be really strong!
boy: Well ...
14: Was it hard? To beat the king I mean.
boy: No, no, of course not. Not for me.
16: Hold it! Hold it I say!
16: That's no hero, that's Boyle the Horrible!
Ray: You're right! It ^is Boyle the Horrible!
Melvor: I'd all but forgotten about him!
16: I told you nothing gets past these eyes!
boy: Hey, let's calm down for a second ... let's not forget who just saved these boys from a goblin king. 
16: Get him boys!
boy-a: I just ^saved you! This is how you're repaying me? 
Haaf: Silence, villain!
Ray: What should we do with him?
16: Let's burn him at the stake!
Haaf: Great idea!
boy-w: What!?
Ray: Cool! I don't think I've ever seen it used!
Haaf: Let's do it tomorrow, though. I'm starving. I haven't eaten for two days! 
16: Boys, take the villain to the jailhouse.
16: We'll execute him tomorrow after we've all had a good meal and a nice night's sleep. 
Melvor: We'll light up Windshire!
boy: Whatever happened to singing my praises?

Event 62: S.Tabitha
this: I don't have anything to say ... yet!

Event 30: EV030
29: He's back!
boy2-c: What are all these people -
boy2: Ahhh, that's right. They were mad because they think I'm a villain. 
Haaf: Aren't you?
boy2: Not always ... it's complicated. All I'm doing in is looking for my dog. 
23: Cast him back in the prison, and make sure that witch is in there with him this time! 
ing2-w: No, I can't go to prison! I'm getting married soon! 
ing2-x: Boyle, get them!
boy2-a: Hey ^I'm the ex-overlord here.
boy2: Myst, get them!
Melvor2: ^WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIT!
Melvor2: Perhaps there is another way to resolve this. 
boy2: Fine ...
boy2: Ingrid, turn them all into creatures.
ing2-x: Why didn't I think of that?
Melvor2: No!! I mean, a non-violent way.
ing2-a: Non violence? What has that ever solved?
boy2: Absolutely nothing.
24: I agree. All this senseless non-violence has to stop!  
28: We haven't even used our witch-burning stake ^a ^single ^time since we got it. 
Melvor2: Just hear me out!
Melvor2: The Boyle we met in that cave was a hero!
boy2: I helped you only so I could save Fang.
boy2: I would do anything for Fang.
29: ^Anything, you say? That's interesting.
29: Perhaps we ^can reach some kind of agreement.
29: Our windmill has been in a state of disrepair for some time now. 
28: People speak of a ghost ... none who have entered to fix it have returned. 
boy2-w: No way! Ghosts don't fight fair!
29: If you defeat him, we may forgive your misgivings. 
23: ^He's probably the one what caused it!  
28: Now, now, Allen. We have no way of proving that. 
24: Close your loud mouth before it gets you into more trouble, Allen. 
ing2: We'll do it, but you have to give us access to your magic store. 
28: Deal.
mys2: And the general store!
28: You can make use of any of our stores.
28: But don't you even ^think about leaving Windshire!
25: And while you're in there ...
25: Maybe you could eradicate all of the ghosts for me? 
25: I ... live in the windmill.
boy: We'll consider it.
28: And remember.
28: Don't even ^think about leaving!

Event 65: EV065

boy: I'd better keep a low profile. I don't want to be hunted down. 
boy: I'll just head straight for the ferry.

Event 55: S.Elsie
this: Farming has gotten more difficult since they opened that big prison. 
this: I've been instructed to grow bad tasting crops for the prisoners, and good tasting ones for the  citizens. 
this: And then I have to grow premium crops for the mayor. 
this: Ughh, it's all so confusing. And I've mixed up the orders on more than one occasion. 
this: The mayor was not amused. I almost got sent to prison for it! 

Event 17: EV017

Event 2: S.Luca
this: You've gotta help us! We were supposed to be watching the mutton but they escaped! 
Henriette: Aye, escaped they did. Saw it with me own eyes. 
this: We've gotta get them back or Mommy will give us a hiding! 
Henriette: Aye, give us a hiding, she will.
boy: Why can't you round them up yourselves?
this: Mommy can see us through the window. We gotta keep waving so she doesn't get suspicious. 
Henriette: Hi Mommy! We's just playing!
this: If you help us, we'll give you the magical item we found in the cellar! 
this: I'm not much of a cow herder, but I do like the sound of that magical item. 

Event 84: S.Shandy5
this: I'll just wait out here. Let me know when the ghosts are gone. 
this: Oh, you got rid of the ghosts?
this: Huzzah!
this: Looks I'm back to living rent free!

Event 35: S.Wes
this: I heard there was a ghost in the windmill, and that's why nobody is allowed in there anymore! 

Event 54: S.Lucy
this: Windshire is a simple town, with simple people and simple pleasures. 
this: And a long and complicated history ...
this: But we don't talk about that often.

Event 56: S.Mark
this: You must be new here! Feel free to explore the town as you like, just stay away from the windmill. 
this: Seriously, the windmill is off limits.

Event 58: S.Lorelai
this: Farming has gotten more difficult since they opened that big prison. 
this: I've been instructed to grow bad tasting crops for the prisoners, and good tasting ones for the  citizens. 
this: And then I have to grow premium crops for the mayor. 
this: Ughh, it's all so confusing. I've mixed up the  orders on more than one occasion. 
this: The mayor was not amused.

Event 57: S.Laurence
this: This marvellous prison was built to containcaptured villains. 
this: Now, all we have to do is capture them ...

Event 60: S.Willy
this: I saw an odd purple glow in the trees just up those stairs. 
this: I walked a bit closer, and I swear I saw a pair of eyes!

@a: Accept
@b: Deny
boy: We can do this.
boy: I don't like to encourage reading.
boy: No more jobs.

Event 63: S.Andreas
this: The Briar Woods are to the south, but I'd stay away if I were you. 
this: Trolls, goblins and ravens are all that await you in that place nowadays. 
this: One of the villagers even swears he was accosted by a scarecrow. 

Event 53: S.Penny
this: Welcome to Windshire.
this: I hope you enter with good intentions, we have the best prison system on the mainland. 
this: Plus, the mayor recently bought a giant stake to burn witches! 
boy-w: Yikes! I better tell Ingrid not to come here for a holiday. 
this: So I hear we're not even using the stake now.
this: I don't imagine this will go over well at the next town meeting. 

Event 61: S.Henry
this: I wish we could afford a better place. My poor  cows want to run free, but they never get to leave  our backyard. 
this: I suppose I should be grateful for what I have. My neighbor's farm recently got turned into a prison. 
this: Oh, you found my novel pages!
this: I'm so grateful! I'm going to give you a ^huuuuuge reward! 
this: Hmmm ...
this: It seems I've improved a lot while these were sitting in the windmill. 
this: Most of it useless to me now.

this: Sorry.

Event 79: EV079

5: That's right!
t-this: Even me.
5: I heard that!
this: You're free to come and go as you please.
this: Nobody can escape the overseer's watchful eye anyway. 

Event 52: S.Ivy
this: I'm having a hard time finding somebody to watch my garden. 
this: It keeps getting picked at by the crows.
this: Would you be interested in standing watch?

Event 59: S.Peregrine
this: The ferry to the Whisper Woods is just to the east. 
this: Why anybody would want to ^go to the Whisper Woods is beyond me. 

Event 68: EV068
Melvor3: He has emerged! The hero has returned!
boy-w: Where!? Hide me!
mys: He's referring to you, Boyle.
boy-w: Oh ...
boy-h: Of course.
89: Boyle the Horrible, it turns out we were wrong about you! 
90: You're ^completely harmless!
boy: Well, I mean ... there was ^some truth to it.
70: Nonsense! We see now you are a beautiful person!  
89: Boyle, somebody wants to speak to you.
75: Boyle, I am so sorry that I implied you were the one who caused windmill to stop working. 
boy: Don't worry about it.
75: I embarrassed myself. As recompense, I stubbed my toe hard on the kitchen table. 
boy-w: You didn't have to- $end
75: And I will do it each morning! So as to never forget the pain I cause when I open my ^loud mouth! 
boy: You really don't have to -
75: Waste not another word on me, Boyle the Beautiful, for I am not worthy! 
70: Now get out of here you scoundrel! $w.20 Rack off!! 
ing: We really must be going now ...
70: Of course, we'll get out of your way.
mys: So, Boyle, how does it feel to be the hero rather than the villain? 
boy-c: Hmmm ...
boy: ^Almost as rewarding. 
boy: Only now, instead of having people seeking revenge against me ... I have them seeking  forgiveness. 
boy-h: It feels really nice to be owed something.
ing: Look at you, pretending to be a hero. Come on, let's get back to Wyrmwood. 


Map 32: Wyrmwood

Event 27: T.Boyle's House
ing: Locked.
mys-w: Oh no, it's ^locked!
ing: I bet he keeps a spare key around here somewhere. 

Event 20: S.Hadir
this: It can be hard living in a town of retired villains.
this: Everybody here has such an ego about themselves. 
mys-c: You seem normal, why do you live here?
this: I married into it.

Event 14: U
ing: This looks like it belongs to Boyle.

Event 17: U
boy: I have a haunch I'd regret purchasing this.

Event 3: U
ing: Who does Boyle think he's fooling with this thing?
ing: Leave it to Boyle to hide the key in the most obvious place. 
mys-w: Ingrid, you broke it!
ing: Heh. Oops.
mys: Boyle is going to be furious!
ing: We're saving his life, he'll have to live with it.

Event 16: S.Bertrand
boy: The festival is over. Why is your stuff still here?
this: I've decided to stay here and set up a store.
boy: What do you have to sell?
this: Well, this gargoyle ...
boy-w: You got the gargoyle!?
this: Nobody wanted it, so I got it for one ticket. It's funny how things seem to work out sometimes. 
boy: That gargoyle would look great in front of my house ... how much? 
this: Oh, I could never part with it ...
this: Unless ...

Event 19: U
boy: I have a haunch I'd regret purchasing this.

Event 13: S.Cosmina
this: Sometimes I wonder if it's even worth being evil anymore. 
ing: I've wondered that myself before.
this: Are we really the great former evil beings we make ourselves out to be? 
this: Or are we just fooling ourselves?
this: Were we doomed to this life of evil, or did we really choose it for ourselves? 
this: I love causing trouble.
this: But I'd be lying if I said it didn't wear on my soul.
this: This is going to sound strange, but sometimes I find it more rewarding to contribute, rather than  destroy. 
ing: That ^does sound strange.
this: Helping people has become a more common pastime for me recently. 
this: It's surprisingly rewarding.
this: Have ^you $w.45 tried it?
ing-a: Never.
this: Maybe you should.
this: It's kind of fun, in a backwards sort of way.
this: The time has come to renounce our evil ways and seek forgiveness from the oracle of Aveyond. 
this: Will you join me?
ing-x: But being evil is ^so much fun!
this: That's what I ^used to think- $end
ing: Alright, that's enough. I know you're a priestess.
this: What!?
this: Speak not such horrible words to me!
this: The mere thought of one of those things scalds my brain! 
ing: Aveyond is in danger, the oracle has been turned to stone. 
ing: You need to return immediately.
this: Fine, I'm going.
this: But my work here is not yet complete.

Event 43: EV043
Evil4: We're doomed!

Mayor: Calm down everyone.
Evil4: Look!
Evil4: Boyle's returned from the mist!
Evil5: He's alive!
boy: I come bearing news. Someone stole the Mist Queen's youngest son. 
Evil4: Oh ...
Evil4: Is she mad?
boy: Well she covered the town in mist.
Evil4: So ...
boy: She threatened to cover the whole world in mist if he isn't found soon. 
boy: Worse, Fang is still lost in the mist. Unless we can find her son, he could die in there. Followed by  us. 
Evil4: Are you suggesting that ^one ^of ^us does the work of a hero? 
boy: Sounds of horror and dismay.
boy: If we're to save Fang and the village, we'll need to go to Aveyond and ask for help from the Oracle. 
boy: More gasps of horror. A witch faints.
boy: Oh, come on people. We're ^retired! She's not going to do anything to us. So who's goingn to go? 

Event 31: EV031
boy: She'd never look for us in her own house!
Fang: ...
boy: You think it's a bad idea? Fine.

Event 2: S.Margaret
this: Get away from me Boyle! I know what you're up to! I've been cultivating this pumpkin garden for an  entire year! 
Boy: What am I going to do to it?
this: Don't think I haven't noticed Hellemy looking at my pumpkin garden with that amber glow in his eyes! 
this: You're always scheming with him. I can tell when you've got pumpkin on the brain. 

Event 26: T.Ingrid's House
boy: She'd never look for us in her own house!
Fang: ...
boy: You think it's a bad idea? Fine.
ing: Wait outside.
ing: I have a lot of valuable things.

this: I've found the house that I want, but I can't get to it! 
this: My beanstalk is taking too long to grow.
this: I think it may be time to get some god water.
this: Rumor has it that it exists at the very peak of the Royal Mountain. 
this: For me, it would take years to journey that far.
this: But for a gargantuous beast such as yourself ...
this: Bring me the god water and I will make it worth your while. 
this: You may even get to meet the Black God.
this: Do you have the god water?
boy: I'm working on it.
this: Do you not want to meet the Black God?
boy: Of course I do. I'll get it.
boy: We have the god water.

boy: Okay.
boy: It worked, the beanstalk grew.
this: Perfect. Now there is just one more thing to do.
this: We will need to make an offering to the Black God. 
boy: This is getting quite serious.
this: Slather the mushroom at the top of the mountain in covey balm, and the Black God will judge me. 
this: If I am worthy, I will receive a new house.
this: Let's go!

this: I ... am.
this: Forgive me, I must have been stewing in my anger for too long. 
this: So, you looking for a weapon?
rob: I like that one you're working on there.
this: Sorry, this one is special. I'm saving it for a certain demon. 
boy-w: You're supplying the demons with weapons?
this: Just one demon. Straight to the heart.
this: It's a unique blade. The more demon blood it spills, the more power it gains. 
boy: That's good to hear. So where is this demon?
this: In the Shadow Lands, enslaving my town.
boy: Do you know how break the elemental barrier on Skull Mountain? 
this: I'd need to take a closer look at it, but I think so.
boy: In that case, I've got an idea.
boy: We'll help you fight this demon, and in return you will help us with the barrier. 
this: Okay, but my sword isn't ready yet. I'm about to head down to the forge to finish it off. 
this: It's very dangerous down there. And there are monsters. 
this: But if you're trying to climb Skull Mountain, I doubt you're worried about that. 
boy: Exactly.
mys-w: Speak for yourself, I'm ^terrified!

rob-s: Oh ...
phy2-h: Help me defeat this demon, and I'll make you your own special sword.

phy2: You seem like a powerful warrior. That old sword and shield won't do for you. 
rob-w: Oops! I forgot to give Galahad's equipment back! 

Event 2: EV002
vn-row-a: It's a Draghar!
vn-rob: Great, let's ask him how to get through the barrier.

this: You're a brave man to complete such a task.
this: The very thought of going ^near a scarecrow is enough to give me nightmares. 
this: As promised, here is your reward.
this: This crow wishes to join you on your quest.
65: Gyacoo!
this: He's my bravest son. He will battle any enemy, and peck any briars without discretion.

boy-c: Who are you?
58: I am the druid of Briar Woods. I think I can help you. 
58: I saw you fight those goblins in the cave. You are very powerful. 
58: I can help you get through these briars, but you will have to take on a foe much more formidable than  the goblins. 
boy: Not trolls I hope.
58: Worse ...
58: The ^scarecrow!
58: The most powerful of all demons. Myself and my crows can only cower in fear at its power. 
58: Defeat the scarecrows, and we will have access to the crops once more.

58: If you destroy all of the scarecrows in the Briar Woods, I have a special gift for you.

boy: Myst, you administer the potion while I oversee the whole thing. 
ing: No.
ing: Here's what we're really going to do - Boyle, you'll sit down to a cup of tea with her. 
boy-a: Why would I drink tea with that wretch?
ing: If she's the only one that drinks it, she'll think something is up. Trust me, it's the only way. 
boy-a: Argh! Fine, just don't get the drinks mixed up!
ing-h: Don't worry, I won't.

boy: Come on Ingrid, this is the only way.

boy: If you lose, I'll let you have my throne.
ing: The cool bone one? Fine, I'll play.
ing2: So what are you terms then, paladin?
21: Nothing too complicated. Should you lose, you will return to Castle Town $w.45 and ^marry ^the ^king! 
ing2-c: Marry the king? That's absurd. Why would you want - 
ing2-a: Wait a minute ...
ing2-a: You ^sneak! Get out of here!
21: Too late! All two card flip challenges are final. Face me, and become my wife! 
ing2: I can't. I'm already promised to another.
21: It matters not!
21: Commence!
21: Heroine!
ing2: Creep.
21: ^Wayward ^daughter!
ing2-h: Swamp rat. You lose!
21: ^Nooooooo!
21: I was so close!!!
21: Fine, you've ruined me. I guess I'll just slink back to my castle now. 
ing2: Nice try, you're joining the crusade.
21: Surely you jest! I am not a warrior.
ing2: You're the king, register yourself as one. You know the rules of two card flip. You have to do  whatever I want. 
21: $s.1 Surely $w.45 $s.3 you jest.
ing2: I almost had to marry you! You're getting off lightly compared to that.  
ing2: Just be thankful we have to save the world or you'd be doing something a ^lot less dignified. 
21: I find your cruelty intoxicating.

Event 30: U.Prince

boy5: Hold up a second.
boy5: Myst and I will wait outside.
ing5-c: Why?
boy5: We have no business talking to that wretch. We'll just get in the way. 
ing5: Oh come on boyle, do you think I'd let her ^curse you? 
boy5: Myst is still innocent, she doesn't need to lay eyes on that creature. 
ing5-a: Fine, have it your way! She'll be at our wedding and you won't be able to hide from her then! 
mys: Congratulations on your wedding, Boyle.
boy-s: It's not what you think ...
mys-h: I know things are different here but weddings are still very much a part of my culture! 
mys: I look forward to my wedding day. 
mys: I hope we rescue my brother soon so I may begin searching for a mate. 
mys-s: I'm already quite behind. 
boy: I'm sure Ingrid could help you take care of that.
mys: I'd never marry a man from this place. Mother tells me humans are all vain and self-serving. 
mys: So far she hasn't been wrong.
boy-w: You say that like it's a bad thing.
boy: Meanwhile, look what I'm going through to rescue ^your brother! 
mys-c: ...
mys-h: Of course, the  ^ego thing you mentioned earlier. You must have a very big ego. 
boy-a: That's not what I meant!
boy: But yes, I do have a big ego. That's what makes me so good. 
mys: And it appears to be self-sustaining.

Event 13: EV013
boy4: With the ^biggest $w.15 butcher knife $w.15 you've ever $w.15 seen $w.15 in $w.15 your $w.15  life. 
mys4-h: Ha ha ha!
boy4-h: Yeah.
mys4: The witch is back!
boy4: So ... what of the prince?
ing4: She's not cooperating. But I don't blame her, she's in love. 
ing4: Never mind, we'll have to poison her.
boy4-w: Poison?
ing4: Yes. One sip of my blabbermouth potion and she'll tell us anything we want. 
ing4: Unfortunately, I used up most of my ingredients making my special concoction for you. 
boy4-s: Why do you seem so much more competent when you're causing grief for me? 
ing4-h: Because you're worth it, my love!
mys4: You're lucky to have love like this Boyle. In my land, people are not so forthcoming with their  emotions. 
boy4: I'm sorry Ingrid, I only have room in my heart for one creature, and it's Fang, not you. 
ing4: Don't worry, I've got a cure for that.
ing4-c: Or should I say ...
ing4-x: A curse!
ing4-x: Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
ing4: Once the potion is done, I can use these glass slippers to teleport back to my house and make it. 
boy4-w: You have teleporting slippers!?
boy4: Why don't we just go to the Shadow Lands ^now? 
ing4-a: Because they don't work like that!
ing4: They can only go to my house.
ing4: And as soon as I leave, I'll be sent to where I first used them. 
boy4-s: Oh ...
ing4: I can use them from our items menu at any time.
ing4-c: But I'm missing the secret ingredient - hot spice. 
ing4-c: I wonder if they sell it in Castle Town.
mys4: Nope.
ing4-c: How do you know?
mys4: I would have picked up on the scent. There's no hot spice in Castle Town. 
ing4: Well aren't you just a know-it-all.
ing4: I guess we'll have to harvest our own then.
ing4: I'll also need a mineral man to calm the potion.
ing4: Have you sniffed any of those?
mys4: Sorry, I don't know what that is.
ing4: Maybe somebody will sell us one.

boy2: Do you mind explaining exactly what this place is. 
hib2: This is the dream realm.
hib2: People have a tendency to believe their dreams are disconnected from reality. 
hib2: But in fact, they all occur in a persistent realm known as the dream world. 
boy2: What? Why have I never heard of this place before? 
hib2: The dream plains are a sacred place, with access granted to only the most enlightened  individuals.  
hib2-h: Incidentally, they're also a great place to find clients! 
hib2: People usually only encounter this particular part of the dream realm when they've been infected. 
hib2: Animals are more in touch with nature. You've probably seen a few of those around here. 
boy2: Does that mean all the animals I've been fighting in here ... are real animals? 
hib2: Yes.
hib2: But don't worry, you were just waking them up.
hib2: You can't actually hurt yourself in the dream realm. 
boy2: Great, so who do we fight?
hib2: I'm afraid it's not that simple.
hib2: All dreams stem from ideas and beliefs.
hib2: Sometimes these ideas can run away with themselves, allowing corruption to set in. 
hib2: We'll need to delve into your consciousness to find the source of the corruption. 
boy2: And then what?
hib2: We kill it.
boy2: I  knew it!
hib2: We'll need to see if we can find the place where your nightmare occurs. 
hib2: Once we're there, we'll have to see it through to completion without waking up.

boy: I'm retired. These days I'm closer to a hero.

boy: The fate of my dog was at stake. I had no choice. 

Event 24: S.Woman6

this: His eye has caught those elegant frames on more than one occasion. 
this: But he would never buy something from his own people. He doesn't believe in it. 
boy: Thanks.

Event 7: S.Man2
this: Life is good here. Our fortifications and paladins keep us safe from all threats.

Event 16: S.Man12
this: The king is distraught over the sudden illness of his daughter. 
this: I've never seen him so upset!

this: Only 2500 gold. Interested?
boy: Can I just get another one of the first ones?
this: You bought the last one.
@a: Buy (2500 gold)
@b: Don't buy
boy: Fine, I'll take it.
boy-a: Hey! This is the exact same as the previous one! 
this: To the untrained eye.

boy-w: The middle of the night? 
boy: You're dreaming. $w.30 Just as I will be at that hour. 
mys-h: You mean having a nightmare!
boy-a: Only if I dream about you!
rob: Boyle, the town is in danger, we have to help!

boy: Robin is my representative, he will go in my place. 
this: Very well, I'll arrange for the wake-up call.

boy: It's locked.

Event 4: U.Angel
sys: The goddess statue looks at you expectantly.
sys: The goddess statue looks at you as if to say 'Is that all?' 
The goddess statue is satiated for the time being.
The goddess statue looks as if she is in dire need of covey balm. 
You begin to slather the statue with covey balm but  the sun hits her in a way that implies 'Just leave the  balm, I can do it myself.' 
The goddess statue seems satiated for the time being. 
The goddess statue would appreciate a bitter cheese sandwich. 
The goddess is apprehensive about imparting good luck upon one who would readily withold honey  butter biscuits. 
Boy: Butterscotch biscuits? What does a goddess need with them? 
Ingrid: Come to think of it, how are we determining these requests just by looking at this goddess? 
Hi'beru: We've fallen victim to the power of telepathic suggestion! 
Myst: What's that?
Boy: Magic!
The goddess gazes lifelessly at no particular thing, as if to say 'Dare thee skulk from thy obligations?" 
Boy: Nice try, buster!
Smashes statue and the troll is there.
Troll: Come on guys, I'm just trying to make a dishonest living! Is there anything wrong with that? 
boy: Not inherently, but you crossed the wrong dark lord. 
Troll: Dark lord? Wait! My powers of persuasion could prove invaluable to you! 
boy: Hmmm ...
The goddess statue's continued silence conveys an intense desire for Boyle to accept the troll's proposal. 
boy: The goddess statue has a good point.
boy: Fine, you can be a minion, but don't try any of those tricks on me. 

Event 21: S.Woman3
this: I heard that a witch lives somewhere outside the castle grounds. 
this: Can you imagine it? ^Ugh!
this: I had to wash my hands three times just from ^hearing about it! 
boy: Yes, witches ... truly deplorable creatures.
ing: Don't worry, I've got just the thing to fix you up.
this: Oh, really? I'd like to hear about it.
boy: She's kidding.

Event 35: S.Child3
this: Mommy never lets me go outside because there might be demons out there! 
this: I don't care, I'm not afraid of them!

Event 13: S.Man8
this: Please, move out of the way. I'm waiting for the paladins to return. 

Event 25: S.Woman7
this: I think ... I think a squirrel spoke to me when I was in the woods! 
this: I must be going crazy. I need to see a doctor or a wizard to sort myself out. 

Event 29: S.Woman11
this: A paladin spoke to me the other day! I still remember his exact words ... 
this: He said, ^here, ^hold ^my ^helmet ^while ^I ^drink ^from ^this ^fountain. 
this: Oh, to be able to live that moment again ...

Event 27: S.Woman9
this: I always give generously to the goddess statue, but the other day it asked for my lunch.

Event 82: Archie2
this: Good, you're awake.

Event 63: S.Guard
this: The king is this way.

Event 70: S.Ceanna
this: I appreciate the work the paladins do.
this: The demons need to be taught a lesson.
this: Those demons really are merciless, they deserve everything they get. 
this: Complete demon eradication is the only way forward! 
this: But still I wonder, ^do ^demons ^feel ^pain ^too?
this: If demons truly can feel pain, is it not possible to end the fighting $w.45 without fighting? $w.10 
this: Maybe the demons would stop fighting us if we showed them alternatives like love and compassion. 
this: We should start an army of our own - an army of forgiveness. 
this: It's time to put an end to the fighting and beg forgiveness from the oracle of Aveyond. 
ing: I don't think we'd have much luck, she's been turned to stone. 
this: What are you talking about?
ing: Hercules did it. He's been conspiring with demons. 
this: Demons defiled the sacred realm of Aveyond!?
this: They will know pain unlike they have ever imagined! 
this: Though they may beg for it, death will not come quickly! 

Event 64: S.Guard2
this: Nobody causes trouble in the food court when ^I'm on duty. 

Event 77: S.Silas Graves
this: You need a mineral man?
ing: Yes please.
this: I have more potent things.
this: But only after dark.
this: I've no more mineral men.

Event 20: S.Woman2
this: I need a paladin to come and save me from my life of chores of homework. 
this: But the king has them all pre-occupied with some silly cruade! 

Event 18: S.Man13
this: I wish those children would stop playing their hiding games. 
this: Yesterday I found one hiding in my food crate!
this: Luckily none of my customers saw it, so I didn't have to throw that crate of food away. 

Event 36: T.Inn

boy: So what was that midnight thing about?

boy-w: ...

mys: He said they would likely have maps of the castle in the library so we should head there. 
boy: That's actually a good idea, Robin.
rob-h: Hee hee, thanks!

this: You're welcome to visit him whenever you like.
this: To your left is the market place.
this: And to your right, $w.45 well ... that's where the $w.45 ^not ^well ^offs live. 
this: You probably won't find anything to your liking over there. 
this: But it depends on your taste I suppose.
this: We encourage you to explore the town fully.
this: In fact, if you find the five red tags and bring  them to me, I'll give you something special. 
this: Just something to think about while you're exploring. 
this: Have fun exploring the town.
this: Oh, looks like you found all the red tags.
this: Good work, here is your reward.
this: I have to greet other people now.

Event 69: S.Edgar Highhand
rob: According to this list, you should be in the king's army. 
this: I'd love to be ... but, I don't have the right equipment. 
rob: What's wrong with what you're wearing?
this: I damaged it fighting a werebear.
rob-c: A werebear, you say?
this: I won't leave this town again unless my armor can resist werebear claws. 
rob: I'll speak to the blacksmith.
this: I need werebear armor before I can even consider joining the crusade.

Event 11: S.Man6

mys: It looks like there's something in there ...
ing2: Well ... what is it?
mys2: It's quite shiny.
mys2-c: Looks like a knife.
ing2-w: A knife? Like the kind I use?
mys2: Maybe.
ing2-x: Get it out! Get it out!
mys2: I can't reach it.
ing2: I need that knife!
mys2: It's too cramped. We'll have to come back later.
ing2-x: I need it ^now!
boy2-c: Ingrid ... you've turned Myst into a snake!
ing2-w: I did?
ing2-h: I did!
ing2-x: I learned a new transformation!!!
ing2-h: Now get me that knife!
ing2-x: This will do nicely!

Event 70: EV070
row-h: Ahaa!
row-h: They were using Draghar artifacts after all!
row: This should give us access to the ancient caves. 
row-x: And one of ^those should lead us to the Draghars! 

Event 54: U.BabyBlocker
boy: It looks magical.

Event 53: EV053
rob: I think we made it just in time!
boy-w: What was that!?
ing-w: The egg we picked up!
ing3-w: It's ... a dragon!
boy3: Our very own dragon?
ing3: It looks like it.
boy3-h: Imagine ...
mys3-h: ... the ...
rob3-h: ... ^possibilities!
x-boy-h: With that thing, we'll be able to go wherever we want! 
x-rob-h: We'll rule over land, sea and air! With a strong hand, but always fairly. 
x-mys-h: We'll swoop down on the mountain top and rescue my brother! 
vn-ing-a: It's just a baby, we're not going to be riding it any time soon! 
vn-ing-a: Do you idiots have any idea how long it takes for a dragon to reach maturity? 
vn-boy-s: Oh ...
vn-rob-s: I thought ...
vn-mys-s: Sorry ...
vn-ing: Its small size will make it the perfect tool for heating up my potions! 
vn-ing: And when it grows up ...
vn-ing-x: ^I will be the one riding it!
vn-ing: Let's go and tell the mayor about what happened. 

Event 2: EV002
ing: There you are! How did you get here so fast?
1: I flew my broomstick. Where's yours? Is it invisible? 
boy-h: Ah ha ha! In a manner of speaking!
ing-a: Be quiet! This sorry crew depends on me being around so there's no use having it with me. 
1: Now ... that reptile was around here somewhere ... 
1: Ahaaa!
1: Don't worry, I brought my little buddy.
ing-w: !!!
1: What's wrong? Did I do something wrong?
ing-w: Where did you learn ^that?
1: I don't know ... I just kind of figured it out.
ing-w: ...
1: Are you proud of me?
rob: THAT $w.30 WAS $w.30 AMAZING!
rob: Can you teach Ingrid how to do that?
ing-a: I have no use for such childish tricks. I deal in poisons and curses. My curses are the best. 
ing-x: Just ask Boyle! Ha ha ha ha ha haa ha!
ing: Give me that thing!
1: Hey Ingrid, do you think I could join you guys on your quest? 
rob-h: Absolutely!
ing: Absolutely not. 
ing: We've got enough brats already, don't need another one. 
1: Okay then ... it's just I was hoping to start a coven ... 
1: You know, so I could teach my arts to other witches. 
1: Travelling the world with you guys would have been a good way to spread the word. 
ing: Teach your arts, you say?
ing: I'll tell you what, I ^may come and see you about it later. 
ing: If I decide to run this coven, I won't be able to join any others. 
ing: But on the other hand, I wouldn't mind picking up a few extra spells. 
1: If you decide to lead it? You mean my coven would belong to you? 
ing: Yes, of course.
1: ...
1: $.1 That would be the BEST $w.30 THING $w.30 EVER! $s.3 
1: You'd be ^SO ^GOOD ^AT ^IT!
ing: I said ^maybe. I ^may come and see you.
ing: Right now, we need to get this potion recipe.
1: The guy said he lived in Tor. He was wearing a green robe. 
1: I'll head home! I'll wait for you to come visit so we can start our coven! 
mys-w: No way, Boyle. ^Nobody can eat that much garlic bread! 
boy-h: It's true.
rob: I reckon my nan could do it, if she tried!

Event 66: EV066
boy-w: Uh oh, it looks like they're up to no good again. 


Map 71: Tournament Grounds
----------------------------------------

Event 12: S.Organizer
this: I haven't seen you around here before. 
this: Must mean you want to compete in the beginners tournament. 
boy: Correct.
this: Should be an interesting one. The previous champion was knocked out in the first round. 
boy-h: You don't say?
this: By his own flail, no less. A shame, really.
this: But that's okay, there's plenty of other contenders. 
this: The quilt merchant has been causing quite a stir this season. 
this: In her last fight, she managed to get ^ten layers on a guy! 
this: Poor thing passed out from exhaustion trying to fight his way out. 
boy: There will be no such shenanigans this time.
boy: We're here to fight and the grand prize will be ours. 
this: You sound confident!
this: But so did Captain Cookie Dagger ... $w.20 poor thing crumbled to pieces in the first round. 
this: And the captain didn't fare well either.
this: Just speak to me when you're ready to start the first round. 
this: Ready for your first round?
@a: Yes
@b: No
boy: Let's do it.
this: Step into the arena.
this: Ready for your next round?
this: Ready for your next round?
this: Bad luck.

Event 35: event3
28: Let's see who you face next!
28: Yes, that's right!
28: These boys have been literally untouchable so far. 
boy2: Untouchable, hey? That's about to change.
37: Right, guys. The mystic has gotten us this far.
37: No matter what happens, just stick to the ^plan.
37: The mystic will come through for us!
36: Right!
38: $sp.1 ACTIVATE DEFENSE FORM ALPHA!!! $sp.3
37: Almost ...
ing2-w: Oh my!
mys2: Are you guys okay?
37: ^Now!
12: A ring out! And our new winners ... those guys!
boy-c: They ... knew that was going to happen.
37: The mystic came through for us! We're going to be rich! 
12: Well, bad luck.
boy: Did they take Fang?
12: They work for the mayor. Their plan was to give him to the mayor's daughter. 
boy-w: What!? The mayor's daughter has Fang?
12: The mayor is on a trip and she's grown restless so she needs something to keep her busy. 
boy: So the mayor is not in Tor at the moment?
12: Nope.
boy: Quickly! We'll recover Fang before the mayor returns! 
12: You fought well. Feel free to move up to the next tournament level. 
mys: But we lost.
12: You don't belong in the beginner's tournament.

Event 13: S.Shopkeep
this: I won't sell you anything nice until you reach a high enough level. 

Event 16: U
ing: I doubt anybody needs this anymore.

Event 32: event1
28: Let's see who your first opponent is.
28: Uh oh, it's the Flamingo Brothers!
31: Prepare to be destroyed.
28: A thrilling match indeed!
28: It was really up in the air for a while there, but it looks like the new guys ^just pulled through with the  victory. 
boy-a: Were you even watching that? They didn't do a thing! 
28: And it hurt them in the end.
12: A fine battle indeed, but anything could happen in the next match. 

Event 34: event2
28: Let's see who you face next!
28: ^Whaaaaaaaaaat!?
28: Oh no ... IT'S THE QUILT MERCHANT!
28: Both teams have shown significant promise so far! 
28: We could be witnessing a grand final quality match right here and now! 
33: I'll wrap this up quickly.
28: ^WOW!
28: Did a single person see ^that coming?
28: Talk about an upset! This team could go on to win it! 
28: ^HOWEVER ... they'll still have to get past one more team. 
28: And I have to say, this team has been causing quite a stir themselves. 
28: So far, their signature defense strategy hasn't yielded a single point of damage! 
28: Will Boyle and the Wonder Kin be able to crack it?
28: We'll have to find out!
12: Nice work guys. I think you have a real chance at winning this thing. 


Map 142: Skull Mountain

Event 11: EV011
boy: Well, here we are.
phy: Interesting ...
phy: Alright, let's see.
phy: Yes, this is an elemental gate.
phy: It's a powerful gate sealed by four elements.
phy: If we find them, we should be able to use them to open the gate. 
phy: I'm not sure what form they take, so we'll have to work out how to deal with them once we find one. 
rob: Alright, so where are these elements?
phy: I have no idea. They could be anywhere in the world. 
phy: Powerful creatures will probably be drawn to them. 

Event 3: EV003
boy2: We appear to be blocked by some sort of elemental gate. 
row2-x: I've seen something like this mentioned in the vaults ... they're supposed to be nigh impenetrable. 
row2: As far as I'm concerned, there's only way we're getting past it. 
boy2: Yes, of course ...
vn-ing-a: You better not be daydreaming about my dragon again! 
vn-boy-w: No, no!!! Of course not! I would never!
row2: I was actually thinking about the ancient Draghar race. 
boy2-w: Yes, that's precisely what ^I was daydreaming- I mean thinking about. 
mys2: But the Draghar's don't exist anymore.
row2-c: What are you talking about?
rob2: Sorry, Rowen. It's a wasteland out there.
row2-h: The stronghold still exists, there are Draghar's living there right now. 
row2-x: I thought you guys knew.
boy2-w: ^Nobody knows that!
row2: The only problem is, how do we get there?
row2-h: I've got it!
row2: If the kobolds in the wasteland have the power to summon dragons ... 
row2: They must have found a way into the caves.
row2: We'll need to borrow their technology.


Map 31: Mir Woods
----------------------------------------

Event 12: U.Mir Tree4
This: It would be unwise to cross me!
This: I am not just a mir tree. I am the tree which the other trees fear. 
This: You are just a mere man, whereas I am a mere tree! 
This: Did that come out right? The word mere had different meanings. 
This: The underlying message is it would be unwise to cross me. 
boy: I've dealt with you before. Your bark is a lot worse than your bite. 
This: Thanks for noticing! It's actually a fortified cedar wood, which is much stronger than pine ... 
This: Wait, you were teasing me, weren't you?
This: Well that was embarrassing.

Event 55: U.Web
boy: What treachery is this?
???1: Your riches won't save you from Fangder's merciless bite. 

Event 7: U.Moneybag
boy: I went through some very dark times in my years as a villain. 
boy: But no matter how bad it got, there always remained a shining beacon that called out to me  through the darkness. 
boy: Yes, the money bag, and its promise of free gold. Even at my most evil, I always saw good in you. 

Event 53: U.Web
boy: It's too strong, I'd never make it.
???4: Fangder never forgets ...

Event 9: U.Mir Tree
boy: Alright, here goes ...
boy-a: Relinquish the mir wood or I'll take it with force. 
this: Be gone, pest! I only give mir wood to those who deserve it! 
boy: Can you just not be difficult this $n time? We both know I'm getting $n that mir wood either way. 
this: Just try it and see how it turns out for you!
boy: Well, you're no Elder Oak.
this: And you're no Ahriman!
boy: But at least I've got mir wood.
boy: Now, reveal the locations of your kin!
this: You have what you came for, leave us be.
boy-h: I only need your wood, not your tears.
this: ... it's sap.
This: If there were more sunlight in these woods, things would have ended differently. 

Event 45: U.Fairy2
boy-h: Ha! Got you now.
Chester3: Nice work!
boy-c: So what happens now that I've caught him?
Chester3: Oh, you'll like this part!
boy-w: What just happened?
Chester3: Don't worry, I didn't hurt him.
Chester3: Go on, try out your new powers.
???2: You will regret burning Fangder's web.
boy: My old powers! They're returning!
boy: But how?
Chester3: That is a story for another time.
Chester3: For now, chase down any of those things you find and bring them to me. That is, if you desire  power. 
boy: Where can I find you?
Chester3: Oh ... around. Heh heh.
boy: I guess I'll keep a look out for more of those things. 

Event 6: U.Mir Tree3
boy: I've come for your mir wood.
This: No problem. None at all. It's yours. Take as much as you like. 
boy-h: Really?
This: No!
This: You only won because I'm a tree.

Event 4: S.Chester2
Chester2: First, catch that little critter for me. I'll wait.

Event 8: EV008
boy: Well, I guess it's time to find those mir trees.

Event 11: U.Mir Tree2
this: You'll get nothing from me today, Boyle.
boy: Is that so?
this: I'm above these petty games now.
this: As long as I don't play answer, there's ^nothing you can do to me! 
this: Errr ... could you help me out here?
boy: I thought you were above talking to me.
this: I'll ^give you the mir wood. I don't even need it!
this: Here, I'll break it off myself.
boy: See how easy that was?
this: I hope you won't tell anybody about what just transpired here.  

Event 10: EV010
boy: Well, there's the mir tree.
boy: It's not going to be fun, but as Ingrid says, somebody has to do it. 
boy: I suppose I can't blame her. I really am the only one in Wyrmwood capable of such a task. 

Event 16: S.Chester
this: Nothing to see here ... please carry on.
boy: I need to see a mir about a log.

Event 14: EV014
Chester2: Oh ... hello again. I kind of wish you didn't see that. 
Chester2: Fine, I've revealed myself now, I may as well involve you in this. 
boy: Actually, I'm kind of busy with something else.
Chester2: Too late. You've seen too much.
Chester2: And trust me, you'll enjoy this.
Chester2: First, catch that little critter for me. I'll wait.

Event 52: U.Web
boy: It's too strong, I'd never make it.
???3: Keep burning Fangder's webs ... see what happens ... 

Event 13: EV013
boy: Ingrid would tan my hide if I went back without the Mir Wood. 


Map 83: Windy Valley
----------------------------------------

Event 22: EV022
18: Nice job, boys. The troll will be pleased.
19: Let's EAT THEM NOW!!!
18: Don't be a fool! We need to feed the troll now, or he will be mad. 
20: He doesn't need to know about this!
17: I'm going to get him!
18: Dont' you dare!
19: Errr ... 
19: This is awkward. I'll leave.
boy2-c: $s.1 ... Ingrid? $s.3
ing2: Yes, Boyle?
boy2-w: NOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME FOR ONE OF YOUR TRANSFORMATIONS!!! 
ing2: Yes.
ing2-s: But it's too cramped in this cage ... there's not enough room to cast anything. 
boy2-w: Well you better do something, because we're very close to being troll food! 
rob2: I didn't think it would end like this.
rob2: But if it does, I just want you guys to know that it was an honor fighting beside you. 
rob2: Especially, you, Boyle.
rob2: You raised me with a firm hand, but always out of love, and never anger. 
rob2: You taught me what true friendship really is.
mys2-s: I must admit ... the outside world was not what I thought it would be. 
mys2-s: If I'm being honest, the only thing I would have done differently ... would be to rescue my  brother. 
ing2-s: Well, if we're going to be troll food, I may as well tell you this, Boyle. 
boy2: Tell me what?
ing2-s: The marriage curse that I put on you ...
rob2-w: Somebody is coming!
27: Wow! $w.30 Really?
mys2-w: Herman?
19: The time has come.
19: Remove the cage!
18: What's going on here?
18: Where did this ladder come from?

Event 38: EV038
34: Uh oh, they've seen us!
34: Quickly, follow me!
34: We should be safe up here.
boy3-h: That's them dealt with!
rob3-c: Yes, but ummm ... wasn't there also a troll?
boy3: Ha! That master troll wasn't so tough.
34: That wasn't the master troll ...
34: ^That is the master troll!
boy3-w: Yikes!
rob3-w: Why in the world is he carrying a ladder?
34: I have a theory, but I hope it's wrong ...
boy3-w: What do we do!?
34: I guess he didn't think that one completely through. 
boy3: Where has he gone?
34: He's a smart one. Probably lying in wait somewhere. 
34: I doubt you've seen the last of him.
mys3: Thank you for saving me ... again.
34: Don't mention it. You'll pay me back someday.
34: Of that I am certain.
boy3: We should get going. Make sure we're prepared when we fight that troll. 

Event 63: EV063
mys: Should we wait outside again?
ing: There's no need. She's not so bad.

Event 3: EV003
4: We won't catch ^anything in that cage?
4: Nobody could possibly be ^that stupid? 
4: To stand right where we wanted them to, just because of a big cross? 
16: Alright, alright, I was wrong. What do you want from  me? 
16: Come on, stop wasting time! We have to get these guys back. 
16: If the troll doesn't get his dinner soon, he's going to start eating ^us!

boy2-h: Well, see you later.
mys-s: I can't believe this! I thought we were a team.
boy2: Sometimes being part of a team means letting others do what they need to do. $w.30 Alone. 
mys-a: You never needed this thing, did you?
mys-s: It was all just a trick.
boy2: Yes. To be honest, I had no idea there was anything in there. 
boy2: What ^is that thing you've found, anyway?
boy2: Colby!
boy2-h: Ooh! This is nice!
boy2: Maybe I'll add it to my room of stuff.
mys-a: I'll tell my mother about this!

boy5: Pesky do-gooders. They attack our village every few days. 
mys2-c: So we can't get across?
x-boy5: See that switch over there? They would have cranked that as they left to retract the bridge. 
x-mys2: So what do we do?

Event 100: EV100
mys-c: What is this contraption?
boy: It's a pulley bridge. We'll need it to get to Windshire. 
boy: But it looks like it's been sabotaged. The weights that sit on either side have been removed. 
mys-w: Oh no! What will we do?

mys-h: Sorry.

vn-mys-w: Head back? But I'm coming ^with you!
vn-boy: You've come far enough.
vn-mys: I'm coming with you until the very end, whether you like it or not! 
vn-boy-c: Until the end, you say ...
vn-boy: Well in that case, we'll have to make a detour first. 
vn-boy: The people in Windshire aren't very welcoming of new people. 
vn-boy: We'll have to steal something from the goblins and present it to them to earn their trust. 
x-boy-c: I know of one such thing ...
x-boy: It rests deep in this cave ... but we'll have to get there first.

Ray: It's possible. 
Ray: But I'll need a few things, and I'm ^not getting them myself! 
boy: That's okay, we'll get them.
Ray: Bring me ten pieces of nice wood. That should be enough to put the boat back together. 
Ray: Oh, and a few fairies flew away with the oars, so you'll need to get those back too. 
boy: Fine.
Ray: And of course, I'll need a new figurehead for the ferry.

vn-phy: It's said to be able to shape any blade.
phy2: Done!
phy2: Time to deliver this to a certain demon.
phy2: Bring me your sword, Robin.
phy2: Here you go.
sys: Galahad's sword upgraded.
rob2-w: Wow!
rob2-h: I hope Galahad doesn't mind!

hib2-x: It's okay, you're just having a nightmare.
1: I know ...
1: But I can't make it stop!
hib2-x: I can help you.
hib2-x: Tell me who you are so I can find you when you wake up.

Map 98: Pumpkin House
----------------------------------------

Event 1: S.Vampire
this: Unable to still my disdain any longer, I just up and told her; frankly, dear, your actions were   reprehensible to say the least. 
Bethany: Oh ^myyyyyyyyyy! You ^devil!
Bethany: She must have been ^mooooooortified!
this: Yes, quite. 
Bethany: Quite.
this: Quite.
boy: Who are you?
this: This is Wrymwood, correct? I believe that makes me a retired villain. 
boy: Did you know you were trapped inside this pumpkin? 
this: I vaguely remember an incident occuring ...
this: I've wanted ^so badly to escape, but frankly I've had neither the time nor the inclination to do so. 
Bethany: Oh ^myyyyyyyyyy! You ^devil!
this: I've just been so ^busy!
boy: What have you been doing?
this: Catching up with an old friend.
boy: How long have you been in here? I've never seen you in town. 
this: You know ... I can't really remember.
this: Nor do I have an inkling ^who I am, now that I think of it. 
this: What about you, Bethany? 
Bethany: Oh ^myyyyyyyyyyy!
boy: I'll see if I can find anything out. Libraries are usually filled with information about villains. 
boy: So are you going to go outside now?
this: Right after I finish catching up.


Map 27: Tor
----------------------------------------

Event 44: S.Man2
this: I lost my dog, and the mystic told me exactly where and when he would show up! 
this: He really is a marvellous man!

Event 53: S.Woman3
this: Are you deaf? Turn the other way, and ^keep ^walking! 

Event 62: S.Woman9
this: You look pretty intimidating, did you come here to fight in the arena? 

Event 30: EV030
sys: Hey! You!
boy-w: Hide me!
Mayor: Hey! I see you! Stop walking away from me!
boy-w: Oh ... hi there. $w.30 I don't believe we've met before. 
Mayor: Nice try, Boyle! I haven't forgotten you!
Mayor: You never polished my shoes after I beat you in two card flip all those years ago! 
boy-a: That wasn't a fair game, you cheated!
Mayor: Cheating is the whole ^point of the game!
Mayor: It's time for you to pay up, Boyle.
boy-s: Fine ... where are your shoes?
Mayor: Oh, if only it were that easy! Ah heh heh heh. $w.45 Heh. 
Mayor: I no longer own those shoes. Now, I want something else from you. 
boy-a: Never! I challenge you to a game of two card flip! 
boy: No, two games! The ^first to cancel my debt, and the ^second for your town! 
Mayor: After I defeated you so handily last time? Ha!
Mayor: I gladly accept!
ing-w: Boyle, no! You're terrible at two card flip!
boy-c: Hmmm, she's right ...
boy: Fine, I'll pay my debt.
Mayor: I suppose just one favor then ... I'd better make it a good one ... 
Mayor: Hmmm, this is tough.
Mayor: Boyle ...
boy-c: Hmmm?
Mayor: You're a ... ^bad ^guy, right?
boy: I don't follow.
Mayor: You know ... you're ... a ^villain.
boy: Actually, I'm retired these days.
Mayor: Never mind that, you still have the know-how.
Mayor: You ^did almost rule Tor at one point, remember? 
boy: Tell me what you want.
Mayor: I need you to shut down one of the stores here in Tor. 
boy-c: Why would you want to close a store in your own town? 
Mayor: The shopkeeper is selling relics of the kobolds from Dragon Wasteland. 
Mayor: I don't know what he's up to, but it's certainly not good. 
boy: Why can't ^you kick him out?
Mayor: If I'm involved, people will find out and start asking questions. 
Mayor: I need this to go away quietly.
Mayor: You, on the other hand ... that's kind of your goal in life, isn't it? 
boy: I told you I'm not evil anymore.
mys-h: These days he's just kind of grumpy!
Mayor: Do this for me, and maybe I'll let you see your pet Fang again. 
Mayor: I believe my daughter has been taking good care of him for you. 
boy-a: Let me see him now!
Mayor: Having him here keeps you bound to Tor.
Mayor: I can't risk having you skip town again.
boy: I was  ^chased ^out by a horde of overzealous paladins! 
Mayor: Oh, they were just kidding around!
boy-a: Well it wasn't funny to me!
mys-c: Could this traumatic experience have led to Boyle's irrational fear of paladins? 
boy: I didn't say it was traumatic! I just said they were overzealous. 
ing-h: Yep, I'd say that's why he's scared of paladins. 
Mayor: Better get going. Remember, don't mention me!
Mayor: Come see me at home when you're finished.

Event 46: S.Man4
After talking to the other two
this: Alright, you're just asking for trouble now.
boy-c: Who, me?
this: You were given an opportunity to leave. You should have taken it. 

Event 1: EV001
Guard: Hey! You're not supposed to be in here! 
boy: Oh, this isn't the pet store?
ing: Sorry, I thought I recognized somebody in here.
mys: Sorry.
Guard: Heyyyyyyyyyy! You're not supposd to be in here! 
ing-a: Fine, we're leaving!
ing-a: We'll never get in there with that guard watching the entrance. 
mys: He can't stay there forever ...
boy: Yes, but we don't have a crystal ball. We don't how long it could take. And we don't have time to  wait. 
mys: A crystal ball, you say ...
mys: Remember what happened back at the arena?
boy-a: Those guys knew what was going to happen!
ing-h: Maybe we should pay this mystic a visit ourselves. Find out if he can really see the future. 
Guard: Heyyyyyyyyyy! You're not supposd to be in here! 
ing-a: Fine, we're leaving!
ing-h: Maybe we should pay the mystic a visit. Find out if he can really see the future. 
Guard: Heyyyyyyyyyy! I thought I told you guys to keep out! 
ing-a: Ugh! He's not supposed to be here today. What's going on? 
boy: The mystic must have been a fake.
Guard: ^Heyyyyyyy! Why are you still here?
boy-e: !!!
ing: Well then ...

Event 57: S.Woman7
this: My husband went for a short holiday and should have returned weeks ago. 
this: Should I be worried?

Event 82: S.Regular Guy
this: I wish I had 100 centipede legs.
this: Hey ... you sure have a lot of centipede legs there. I can see them sticking out of your pockets. 
this: Mind if I take 100 of them from you?
boy: I'm sorry but somebody already asked for them.
this: Yes, it was me. I posted the request on that board. 
boy: Oh, really?
this: Thank you for the legs.
@a: No problem
@b: So what are you going to do with them?
this: Did you not read the job board!?
this: It said ^don't ask ^why!
this: Uh oh ... now I'm getting worked up.
this: Arghh! I'm not supposed to get worked up!
this: Oh no, now I can't stop it!
this: No ... No ... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
this: Well, I guess you know my secret now.
this: I really wish you didn't ask.
this: I really wish you didn't ask.

Event 41: S.Villager
this: Tor is the port town on the western mainland.

Event 59: S.Man5
this: Only two types enter this place. Those who have nothing left to lose ... and fools. 
this: It seems I was a fool, because I lost the thing dearest to me ... 

Event 48: S.Man6
this: I suggest you leave. The only thing you'll find this way is my blade. 

Event 66: S.Man13
this: Have I lost my mind or are there a pair of glowing purple eyes inside that tree? 

Event 64: S.Man11
this: I found an artifact and took it to the museum, but they told me it was just a rock. 
this: I was very upset, because I'd spent the entire day collecting dozens of the things. 
this: I've dirtied my best clothes for nothing.

Event 52: S.Woman2
this: Tor doesn't really have a close community. I guess it's because it's more of a hub for travellers. 
this: People mainly come here to fight, buy or hide.
this: Regardless, it will always feel like home to me.

Event 61: S.Man10
this: Tor isn't a very friendly place, but if you do well in the arena, it becomes a ^very friendly place. 

Event 51: S.Woman1
this: Tor is the largest port town on the mainland.

Event 65: S.Man12
this: Have I lost my mind or are there a pair of glowing purple eyes inside that tree? 

Event 54: S.Woman4
this: If you're looking to sail out of Tor, be careful, there are pirates out there. 
this: If you stray from the trade route even a bit, well ... I wouldn't want to be you. 
this: I've heard rumors they even have a kraken!

Event 68: S.Man13
this: Apparently there are creatures in the arena dungeon far more dangerous than any seen before. 
this: But nobody has been good enough to make it that far yet! 

Event 58: S.Woman8
this: The land is slowly returning to the way it was before the dragons arrived. 
this: One day, it will ^all be grass again.

Event 24: EV024
mys: I suppose this is Tor?
boy: Yep. My old stomping grounds.
boy: I learned a lot here. This town holds a very special place in my heart. 
mys: Oh? Did you make a lot of friends here?
boy: Better than that. I ^conquered it. $w.45 ... almost. 
ing-a: You weren't ^close to conquering Tor! 
ing: You challenged the mayor to a game of two card flip for it, and ^lost! 
boy: Yes, but if I'd won, Tor would now be under my rule. 
ing: But you're terrible at two card flip! You don't even have a trick deck! 
boy-a: ^Regardless, $end
ing: You even lost to ^me!
boy-s: Yes, but $end
ing-h: The ^first ^time ^I ^ever ^played!
boy-s: How could I forget?
mys: So do you have a plan for finding a boat?
boy: Yes, we find will a captain and challenge him to a game of two card flip. 
ing-c: Did you forget about your bad luck already?
boy-s: Oh ...
ing-a: Even if you weren't cursed, Tor is home to the best two card flip players in the world.  
ing: None of us are near close enough to being qualified to play them. 
boy: Fine. Then we will simply go to the port and commandeer a ship of our choosing. 
ing: Now you're finally starting to sound like a sane person again. 
mys: I don't know if that's a good idea ... remember what happened in Windshire? 
boy: Don't worry, we'll only be borrowing it for a short while. 
boy: And we don't have to worry about any witch hunts, Tor doesn't have the same community as  Windshire. 
ing-h: So clever! I knew there was  a reason I cursed you to marry me! 
ing-x: Other than as a punishment!
boy: Let's head down to the dock and choose out a ship. I prefer something intimidating but I'll hear other  suggestions. 

Event 56: S.Woman6
this: Sometimes I wonder where the goods in these shops come from, but around here it's usually best  not to question things. 

Event 60: S.Man9
this: I come to Tor for shopping.
this: You can find everything you could ever want here. 
this: And, more imporantly, things that no man in his right mind should ^ever want. Hee hee. 

Event 22: S.Owner
this: So many animals, so little time.

Event 49: S.Man7
this: My father lost everything we had playing two card flip down at the tournament hall. 
this: Now, it's my job to win it all back!

Event 84: S.Mystery Buyer
this: I know everything.
ing: Are you looking for a tiny reptile?
this: Why yes I am.
ing: I need a recipe that will make a tiny man large.
this: Say no more, I have just the thing!
sys: The man begins to furiously scribble notes on a piece of paper. 
this: Finished!
ing-w: That was fast!
ing: Here, you can have this lizard.
this: Thank you, thank you.
sys: The man makes off like a bandit with the tiny reptile. 
ing: Let's see ... the secret ingredient is a witchety grub. 
ing-c: Hmmm ... I'm pretty sure they live in Whisper Woods. 
ing: Miss know-it-all can track their scent for us.
mys-c: But I didn't notice any witchety grub smells in Whisper Woods. 
ing: That's right, they're known to burrow deep underground to hide their scent. 
boy: Fang could track them for us.

Event 45: S.Man3
this: Keep walking. We're here to do a job, nothing more. 

Event 43: S.Man1
this: Have you seen doors with strange markings in the wasteland? 
this: I've heard rumors about of ancient race living underground. 
this: But I think it's more likely just vandalism.
this: The thing is, nobody has ever been able to open one of those doors ... 

Event 50: S.Man8
this: I asked the mystic what card my opponent was going to use in two card flip, and he was right! 

Event 63: S.Woman10
this: I stayed at the inn, and when I woke up somebody had stolen half of my gold! 

Event 23: EV023
boy: Fang! How in the world did you end up in this disgusting, wretched wasteland? 
boy: Never mind, we're together again at last. My quest is complete. 
22: ^Hoooooooold ^it!
22: What is the meaning of this?
boy: This is my dog, Fang. He's coming with me.
22: I'm sorry, but he's mine. I found him in the Dragon Wasteland wandering around. 
22: Were it not for me, he'd be dragon food by now.
boy: I'm glad you saved him, but I'll be taking him now.
22: You'd have to buy him from me ...
boy: Name your price! Myself and my party will spare no expense to recover Fang. 
22: My price is 400 gold coins. Or at least it was ... he sold almost immediately. 
boy-w: To who!?
22: The lord of the tournament grounds.
boy-a: ^What? They're going to make my Fang fight? We have to save him. Quick, to the colosseum! 
ing: He's a storm wolf. They love fighting ... he'll probably enjoy himself. 
boy-a: He's a puppy! He wouldn't hurt anybody!
ing: We're supposed to be commandeering a ship.
boy: Fang takes precedence! To the colosseum!
22: Don't forget, I have an assortment of other animals available, should anything take your fancy. 
boy-a: We're not interested!

Event 21: EV021
mys-w: Boyle! Do you see that?
boy: It's a cage.
mys: Focus!
boy: Okay. $w.75 It's a cage.
mys-a: ^Focus!
boy-h: It's fang!
boy: How did he get in there?
mys: I don't know, but he seems well.
boy: Fang! Fang, it's me!
boy: He's trapped. Quickly, we must get to him!

Event 39: EV039
row2-h: Hi guys!
rob-h: Oh, hello Rowen! Fancy meeting you here!
mys: Thanks for telling us about the end of the world!
row2: Don't mention it. 
row2: You guys get around a lot. You must live pretty eventful lives. 
rob: Actually, we've only been to the shadow lands and the end of the world!  
rob: The rest of the time we were in the Royal Woods. 
ing2-a: She's talking to us! We existed before we met you. 
row2: So what did you guys end up doing after the failed boat scheme? 
boy-w: How do you know about that?
mys: She's a mystic's apprentice.
boy: Ahh, he probably told you, right?
row2-x: Well ... not exactly.
row2: He's not even a real mystic.
boy-w: ^What!?
row2-w: Oh! I thought you'd figured that out by now ... 
row2: He only gives predictions that are in the customer's best interests. 
row2: Then he sends me off to make sure they come true. 
row2: Why did you think his powers only go as far as Tor? 
boy: I ^knew it!
row2-w: Oh! One second!
37: My lost ring! The mystic was right!
row2: Anyway, I've had my eye on you guys for a while. I know a lot about your quest. 
row2-h: I ^also might know where you can get a ship, as well  as a captain to drive it. 
boy-w: You do? ^Where?
row2-c: Ummm, right here ...
boy-c: In ^Tor?
row2-x: Yeah ... I was actually talking about myself.
boy-w: You can drive a boat?
row2-x: Back in my homeland there is an ancient warship from ages past. 
row2: I can probably get it for us.
boy-h: Sounds good to me!
row2-s: There's just one tiny little problem ...
row2: As a young swindler, the ^mystic witnessed the resourcefulness of my people. 
row2: He was so impressed that he paid a witch to cast a curse on me. 
ing-w: ...
row2-s: So long as the curse remains, I'm under his control and I cannot leave Tor. 
rob-s: You must ^really miss your family!
row2-x: Well ... I suppose. But I've always craved a life of adventure. 
row2: It would be really nice I could leave Tor.
ing: Sounds like the work of my sister.
boy-w: ^Another sister?
ing: Don't worry, Gronhilda is a lot more approachable than the rest. She'd probably make us a deal. 

Event 67: S.Woman11
this: I asked the mystic what my husband's favorite food was, and he was ^right! 
this: My husband confirmed it ... although he did follow with ^I ^love ^everything ^you ^cook. 

Event 47: S.Man5
this: Careful, travellers. This is the two card flip tournament hall. 
this: The best players from the world over come here to battle it out in two card flip. 
this: As usual, all two card flip rulings are final.

Event 36: EV036
rob2: So what's the plan here? Are we going to kidnap them? 
boy2: No.
ing2-h: We're going to poison them, right?
boy2: No.
mys2: Reveal what the mayor told us and hope they agree to the terms? 
boy2: Absolutely not!
boy2: We're going to do the first thing all great evil geniuses do ... gather information. 
rob2: And then we kidnap them?
boy2: The method will depend on the situation
boy2: At the moment, a kidnapping is the most likely - 
rob2-h: Yes!
boy2-a: But it is by no means a given!
ing2-c: Ummm, Boyle ...
boy2: Yes?
ing2-s: I was certain it was going to be poison ... 
ing2: I already took the lid of this old potion I found in bottom of my bag. 
ing2: If we don't use it soon it will go bad.
boy2: So throw it out.
ing2: I don't know .. it seems kind of irresponsible to just throw away something this destructive. 
boy2: You make a good point. Alright, use it on Robin. We'll see what happens. 
mys2: No! Don't you do that.
rob2: It's okay, Myst, if it helps Ingrid to ^gather ^information on the potion, it helps everybody. 
mys2-c: ...
boy2: Clever boy! Now you're starting to gain my respect. 
mys2-a: You're just taking advantage of his admiration for you! 
boy2: Of course I am. Why wouldn't I?
rob2: Alright, let's see what this thing does!
mys2-c: ... well?
rob2-x: ...
rob2-x: Never better! $w.30 HYARP!
mys2-w: Oh no ... what have they done to you?
rob2-x: Right behind you, guys! $w.100 HYARP! $w.20 
boy2: Seems normal to me. Come on, let's go inside.

Event 55: S.Woman5
this: Tor was originally a small mining town.
this: Before their sudden disappearance, dragons wreaked havoc on the land, making it easy to harvest  for resources. 

Event 83: S.Ceanna
this: Tor is a very unfriendly place.
this: I feed off that type of energy.
this: I treat people with as little respect as possible.
this: But then again, it ^is nice to be appreciated every once in a while. 
this: Perhaps if I appreciated others more, I would be appreciated more myself. 
this: Maybe my bad attitude is just my broken soul screaming out for help. 
this: Let's put a stop to the nastiness and seek forgiveness from the oracle of Aveyond! 
boy: Time to go back to Aveyond.
this: That terrible place!? I wouldn't last one second there! 
ing: You're not fooling anybody.
ing: You need to return to Aveyond.
ing: The oracle is stone cold.
this: Did you address her courteously?
ing: No, I mean, she's a rock.
this: She's gotten me through a trying time or two.
ing: She's statuesque. 
this: Not my place to comment on that.
ing-a: Go to Aveyond!
this: Fine, I'm going.
boy: You need to work on your delivery.


Map 104: Windmill @windmill
----------------------------------------

Event 76: S.Shandy
this: It's good to be home.
this: Thanks for coming to visit me.
this: You can have this.

Event 67: U
boy: I'd say that's done it.

Event 55: U
mys: We'll need a key.

Event 70: EV070
6: Boo.
6: Leave now or face further torment!
ing: Was that supposed to be the torment?
boy-c: Surely it was just entertainment!
ing: That's what I thought.
mys-w: Yeah ... I wasn't scared either!
6: You mean you aren't scared of me?
6: But I'm a ghost.
boy-h: Ghosts are known as the least effective evil beings in the world. 
boy-c: Why would we be scared?
6: Oh ...
boy: Why are you haunting the windmill?
6: I built it. I have the right.
boy-w: You ^built the windmill?
boy-c: Why would you want to see it like this?
6: I was betrayed.
6: I was to be the mayor of Windshire.
6: Instead, I was thrown from the cliffs alongside my workers by that traitor. 
boy-c: Why would you want to see it like this?
sys: They fight.
6: Okay, I'll go.
boy: Time to turn the Windmill back on.

Event 68: EV068
x-boy: That must be the switch for the windmill blades. 
x-mys-c: I don't think they're blades, Boyle.
x-boy: They would be if ^I ruled this place.


Map 18: Library
----------------------------------------

Event 14: row3
this: Sadly most of it is fiction.

Event 19: EV019
5: Apologies, but I can't hire out books with an impending crusade on the horizon. 
5: Not everybody comes back from these things, you see, and well ... I've lost a lot of books over the  years. 
5: Please understand.

Event 9: EV009
boy: I've found it!
rob3: Well, what does it say?
boy: It appears to be a map of the castle. This could be exactly what we need! 
sys: Boyle rips the map out of the bog and adds it to the inventory. 
rob3-w: Boyle! We can't take that. My library card will be revoked! 
boy: You mean ^my library card, which gives me the right to lay claim to anything in this library $w.45 for  five days or less. 
boy: Let's head to the castle.
boy: ...
boy: Before we go, I have another task for you.
rob3-h: Really?
boy: Hire this book out for me ...
ing3: What is it?
boy-w: Don't show it to her!
rob3: Sorry, Ingrid, I can't show you the book, but it's called ^so ^you're ^dating ^a ^witch. 
boy-a: And don't tell her either!
ing3-x: Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh Boyle ...
rob3-s: ... sorry.
boy: It's okay. Your naivety will ultimately prove useful to me. 

Event 13: hib3
this: Hey! What is this doing here?

Event 16: S.Man6
this: I don't often read, but when I do, it's always something informative. 

Event 12: mys3
this: I found a book about mist wraiths!
this: Ha ha! So that's what they think about us.
this: Totally inaccurate ...

Event 10: rob3
this: I wonder if all of these tales are true.

Event 6: EV006
5: Welcome to the library.
boy2: We're just browsing today, thank you.
5: Very well. May I see your library card? Or would you like to apply for one? 
boy2: I don't need a card. I'm not going to ^borrow anything. 
5: Nobody may enter the library without a card.
boy2: Those things always take forever to sign up for! And I always get asked too many personal  questions. 
5: Relax, it's actually a very simple process, it won't take but a moment. Let's start with your name. 
boy2: ... fine. Robin.
rob2: What?
boy2: No,  I was saying my name is Robin.
rob2-c: I thought it was boyle.
boy2-a: Now it's Robin.
5: Unless it happens to be the word of the day.
5: I hope you are not being disingenuos. I do not appreciate disingenuity in my library. 
boy2: Me? I assure you, I don't even know the meaning of the word. 
5: I'm ^very well-read. It's not that easy to pull the wool over my eyes. 
boy2: Have it your way. Robin, sign up for a library card. We'll go wait over there. 
rob2-h: Leave it to me!
mys: I'll help you.
boy2-a: I can't believe this place!
ing2: It's very excluding. I can't sense a ^single spell book in here! 
boy2: Anybody who called ^me evil never met a librarian. 
ing2: Who even reads books?
boy2: I try to, I just never have the time unfortunately.
ing2: yeah right! You don't even know how to read.
ing2: I always see you reading that spell book I gave you and you still haven't learned half the spells from  it. 
boy2-a: I like to take my time and think about what I'm reading! 
ing2: Yeah, sure. Is Robin done yet?
rob2: I hereby swear, on my family, on my sword and on my sall, that I shall never borrow any book for  longer than three days. 
boy2: Nope, he's still going.
ing2: I suppose we should start planning our wedding. 
boy2: Let's not get ahead of ourselves. You might find a nice troll in the castle dungeon and call the  whole thing off. 
ing2: No, I'm pretty sure I've made up my mind.
ing2: The curse will activate whether I like it or not.
ing2: So, would you like me to invite your mother?
boy2-a: Ha ha.
ing2: Oh Boyle, I'm sure she's over it by now.
boy2: I told you never to speak of her.
ing2: Fine ...
rob2: So long as I continue to draw breath, my commitment to this library shall always remain  absolute and will take priority over all else. 
ing2: What's going on over there?
boy2: Typical library stuff. Have you never signed up for something? 
ing2: No ...
ing2: A few unholy pacts maybe, a blood oath here and there ... but never anything serious. 
boy2: The trick is to never give them your real name. That way, they can't bother you. 
rob2: Finished!
boy2: How did it go?
rob2-c: Ummm, pretty good. I wasn't certain on the spelling of Wolfmane, so I just took a guess. 
boy2: Wolf mane? What are you talking about?
rob2-c: Wolfmane ... your name.
boy2-a: ^What $w.30 ^did $w.30 ^you $w.30 ^do!?
rob2: don't worry, I don't think they'll care about the spelling. It's a very odd name. 
rob2: I can't imagine they'd confuse you with anybody else. 
boy2-a: It's WoldBANE, you fool! And you were supposed to use ^your name, not mine! 
rob2-c: But you said ...
rob2-w: Oh ...
ing2-x: Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
ing2-h: so much for not giving them your name, hey ^Wolfmane? 
rob2-s: Sorry ...
boy2: Forget it. We'll just have to burn it to the ground when we leave. 
rob2: There are countless tales of paladins in here! We can't burn it down! 
boy2: ...
boy2-a: Fine, but if we borrow a book, I'm ^not goingn to return it. 
boy2-a: For at ^least ten days!
ing2: On account of your reading problems, right?
boy2: Come on then, let's start looking for this book.

Event 11: ing3
this: ^Nothing on witchcraft!

Event 15: phy3

Event 1: EV001
mys2: Boyle, wake up!
boy2: No! You're ^my minion! You serve ^me!
mys2: Boyle, you're having night terrors.
ing2: Careful, if you stir him too fast, he'll be frightened when he wakes up. 
mys2-s: Oh, sorry.
ing2: No need to apologize. Here, let me try.
boy2: ^Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!
ing2-e: Ha ha ha ha ha! You should see the look on your face! 
boy2-a: ^What is the matter with you?
boy2-s: You know I don't sleep well ...
ing2-s: I know ...
ing2-e: And it's ^hilarious!
mys2: So, is this the Shadow Lands?
boy2: Afraid not. It looks like we've washed up someplace in the Royal Woods. 
boy2: We're closer, but we'll need another boat.
mys2-h: On the bright side, this place seems a lot friendlier than the places we've been to. 
boy2: Appearances can be deceiving. 
boy2: These woods are actually teeming with foul creatures of the most unsavory variety.  
boy2: Creatures that will give your ^nightmares nightmares. 
mys2-w: You mean ...
boy2: Paladins! The most vile creation in the history of time.  
boy2: Whichever foul demon spawned them must have been in a really sick mood that day. 
mys2: These paladins, they sound terrible.
boy2: They ^are terrible. It was paladins who threw us off that boat. 
ing2: It's true, they are wicked creatures, but they ^can be dealt with if you know how. 
ing2: They're actually a lot like dogs. They act purely out of desire for food and praise. 
boy2-a: Don't you dare compare Fang to a paladin!
ing2: Unfortunately for us, Boyle is well known to them. 
ing2: We're lucky his infamy has degraded so significantly. 
ing2: If his reputation meant anything anymore, they would have done more than just throw us overboard. 
ing2: I guess they don't consider him a threat whatsoever. 
ing2: Aren't ^we lucky!
boy2-a: They were afraid of incurring my wrath! Spineless as always! 
boy2: With any luck, we won't run into them again. We just need to get a new ship and leave. 

Event 13: S.Willem
this: Argh! I had my map ready so I could search for the legendary crab island. 
this: I got careless and the crabs chopped it up into four pieces and scuttled off with them. 
this: If you can find them, I may share the secret of crab island with you. 
this: I need to watch over my raft. I don't want that cut up into quarters. 
this: You found my four map quarters yet?
this: Ahhh, you've found them. Good work.
this: Here, I'll put it back together.
this: Alright, with this I should be able to deduce the location of crab island. 
this: What is crab island, you ask?
this: Well, legend says a ^giant crab makes his home there. 
this: My goal is to meet this crab.
this: However!
this: As you may have noticed, my raft was sadly cut up into quarters while you were searching for  the map pieces. 
this: Alas, we will not be going anywhere just yet.
this: But fear not, once I fix the raft, we will set sail for crab island immediately. 
this: I'll have to fix my raft.

Event 1: S.hib2
hib2: Please hurry.
hib2-w: Ouch!

Event 16: EV016
15: The black god has blessed me!
15: A sign that I remain on the righteous path!
boy-w: Are you sure he wasn't just hungry!?

Event 4: EV004
boy: Alright, you've lived up to your end of the deal. I see no need to throw you in prison. 
boy: You're free to go.
hib: Actually, I was kind of hoping I could travel with you. 
boy-c: Why would you want to come with us?
hib: I'm very new to this whole travelling thing. And, as you know, it didn't take me long to get myself into  trouble. 
hib: As they say, great company inspires great learning. 
boy: I haven't heard that, but I understand what you mean. 
ing-a: No way! This guy creeps me out.
ing: And I don't like this whole idea of curing you of ailments, or curses ... 
boy-s: Well, if Ingrid has a problem with it ...
boy-h: How can I possibly say no?
boy: Just know that if you come with us, you may find yourself doing questionable things. 
hib: My studies have taught me to be very open-minded. 
hib: I believe there is a lot we have to teach each other. 
boy: Perhaps there is.
ing-a: Cure Boyle of anything else, and I'll have a ^lot to teach you about pain. 
hib-w: Yikes!

Event 3: EV003
hib2: Boyle! So good to see you again!
hib2-w: Ouch!
hib2: So did you liberate the man at the ends of the earth of his tiny furniture? 
hib2-w: Ouch!
hib2: I mean regular sized furniture!
hib2: I mean furniture sized proportionately to the intended user. 
hib2: ...
hib2-w: Ouch!
hib2: I think they were happy with that answer. It hurt less ... 
ing2-h: Is the pain proportionate to the size of the pincher? 
hib2-w: Ouch!
rob: So how are you enjoying your first adventure away from home, Hi'beru? 
hib2: It's been very ^humbling so far. Far more than anticipated. And painful. Ouch! 
hib2: But let's talk about my travels later! Please tell me you have the furniture! 
boy: Of course we have it.
boy: So where should we put it?
boy: How about this rock?
hib2-w: ^No! That's the sacred temple!
hib2-w: Ouch!
boy: By this stick wiith fur on it?
hib2-w: That's the traditional crafts museum!!!
hib2: Just ... place it down by me.
hib2-h: Ahh, free at last!
hib2: Well then ...
hib2: Boyle, I hope this whole ordeal hasn't affect your opinion of me. 
hib2: I'm usually a lot more reserved.
boy: ...
hib2: Never mind, I'm sure your opinion of me will grow with time. 
hib2-x: Now, shall we take a look into these dreams of yours? 
boy-h: Yes!
hib2-x: Take my hand ...

Event 2: EV002
boy-c: Hi'Beru?
hib2: Boyle? Is that you? Oh, you've found me! Splendid! 
hib2: I have been eargerly awaiting your arrival. I look forward to helping you - 
hib2-w: Ouch!
mys-c: Why are you lying on the floor, strange man?
ing: That's a good question.
boy: It must be a dream healing technique. Shall I lie down too? 
hib2: No, that won't be necessary at the moment.
hib2: Do you remember the terms of our agreement, Boyle? I asked that I wished only for the chance to  cure you. 
boy: Of course I remember that.
hib2: Great, so I do hope you'll give me that chance by setting me free. 
boy-c: Set you free?
hib2: Yes. You can't see them, but I am fact being detained by a group of fine tiny men. 
hib2-w: Ouch!
hib2: And ladies! Of course! Forgive my crass implications. 
hib2-w: Ouch!
boy: How did you end up in this predicament?
hib2: I promise I'll explain later, but at the moment I answer directly to the little men ... and women! 
hib2-w: Ouch!
hib2: I mean ^women and men!
boy: I promise he wasn't this pathetic in my dream.
hib2: They've agreed to free me, under the condition that I pay them compensation for the the hurt my  flilppant attitude has caused them. 
boy: And if I pay this debt of yours, you will cure me?
hib2: Admittedly, I am still fairly new at this. In fact, this is my first expedition away from my homeland. 
hib2: But I see no reason why I shouldn't be able to cure you. My professor said I was one of his favorite  students! 
boy: So you mean you've never even done this before? 
hib2: Well, my plan was to start small ...
hib2-w: Ouch!
hib2: Figuratively speaking!
hib2: But it appears even tiny people are capable of big dreams. $w.45 And grandiose delusions. $w.10 
hib2-w: Ouch ouch ouch!!!
hib2: I should stop speaking.
boy: So you found me in a moment of weakness and saw your ticket to freedom. 
hib2: ...
boy: I'm impressed. You seem like a resouceful man, so I believe in you. What do the tiny people want? 
hib2: Furniture ... ouch! Tiny furniture!
hib2-w: Ouch! Gender neutral!
ing-h: They want ^tiny ^furniture? That's hilarious!
hib2-w: Ouch! Please, I'm being pinched for your transgressions. 
mys: We can't even see these people. How could somebody make furniture that small? 
hib2: They say there isa man who can do it. To find him, you will need to go to the ends of the earth. 
boy: Tell them we'll do it. Just tell us what they want.
hib2: It's not a metaphor, you literally have to go to the ends of the earth. 
hib2: It's on the continent to the west of here.
boy: How do we find the ends of the earth?
hib2: ...
hib2: They're not sure.
hib2: You'll have to find the way there yourself.
hib2-w: Ouch!
hib2: Please, make haste! They're started biting!
boy: Maybe somebody in Tor can tell us. That's where most rumors are born. 

Event 13: EV013
boy: The time has come.
boy-s: Oh wait, we don't have any covey balm.
ing: I guess we should get some first.
boy: The time has come.

Event 28: EV028
29: Greetings, fine ^sirs and ^sirettes! How can I make this a fine day for you? 
boy2: Alright, we've gathered enough information.
boy2-a: I challenge you to a game of two card flip! 
boy2-a: If I win, I take the store!
ing2-a: ^Boyle!
29: I'm sorry, ^sir, I don't play the game. In fact, I don't even have a deck. 
29: I don't believe in gaining authority over others through treachery. 
29: I prefer going through the usual channels, like  employment for example. 
29: Besides, I don't own the store, so I couldn't make good on your request. 
boy2: Robin ... ready the sack.
rob2-h: On it!
29: So ... are you interested in any of these ^special relics? 
rob2: Right, got him. What should we do now?
ing2-a: You fool! We weren't done gathering information. 
boy2: I'd heard enough. Good job, Robin.
boy2: Besides, he already told us the most important part - he's not the owner. 
boy2: It won't do us any good to kidnap him.
rob2-c: Oh, so should I release him then?
boy2: Hold on, I didn't say that. It seems a waste to just let him go now. 
29: The shop is owned by a man named Scar.
29: He brings the relics in, I just sell them.
boy2: Thanks for the information.
29: Welcome.
rob2: What are we waiting for? Let's go tell the mayor about this ^Scar. 
ing2: There's still the case of the bagged man here.
boy2: I $w.30 ^think $w.30 I may have an idea.

Event 37: T.Innstairs

Event 40: S.Mayor
this: Hello again, Boyle. Did you deal with our little problem? 
boy: Not yet.
this: Hello again, Boyle. Did you deal with our little problem? 
boy-h: Handily, as you might say.
this: What did you do with the storekeeper?
boy: I've got him locked up in a dungeon.
this: Ah, very good.
this: I knew you had Tor's best interests at heart.
this: Which is why I have something else to ask of you. It's very important. 
this: I've had reports that a group of kobolds in the Dragon Wasteland have been trying to summon a  bone dragon. 
this: If they succeed, the dragon would very likely destroy Tor. 
boy: Well, good luck.
this: Aren't you going to help?
boy: Why would I help?
Mayor: Boyle ...
boy-c: Hmmm?
Mayor: You're a ... ^good ^guy, right?
boy: What are you talking about?
Mayor: You know ... you're ... a ^hero.
boy-a: Absolutely ^not!
this: I guess I was wrong about you.
this: Fine, and I was just about to let you see Fang too. 
boy: Fine, I'll do it.
this: Thank you for cooperating.
boy: You were right, they were trying to summon a bone dragon. 
this: I knew it. Did you put a stop to them?
boy: Of course.
this: Good work.
this: The kobolds are not intelligent creatures, they shouldn't be able to do this on their own. 
this: We think people have been supplying them with the means to summon the dragon. 
this: Enemies of mine.
this: Let's put that dungeon of yours to some use.
this: We'll lock up all of my enemies, and see if the kobolds stop. 
boy: A sound plan.
this: You shouldn't have too much trouble finding them. 
this: The first is in the Windshire prison, but I don't feel safe having him there. 
this: The second is in the two card flip hall in Tor.
this: And the third ...
this: The third is you.
this: We'll just capture the two for now.
this: Be careful, these men are very dangerous.
this: One of them is likely the leader of the kobolds.
rob: No problem, we'll just throw a bag over their heads and drag them back. 
ing-a: We can't drag them here from Windshire, that would never work. 
ing: I should be able to make a potion to make them agreeable. 
ing: But I'll need a couple things.
ing: The secret ingredient is spider eyes.
ing: And I'll need a violin to play to it to make it less volatile. 
boy-w: A violin?
mys: Where did we see a violin before?
rob: We didn't.
ing: It must have been before Robin joined.
this: Please track down my enemies and put them in prison. 
boy: All of your enemies are locked up.
this: Thanks. I knew I could count on you.
boy: Do you feel confident the kobolds will leave you alone now? 
this: It's a wait-and-see kind of thing.
this: The most important thing was having my enemies behind bars. 
this: It feels good having them in a dungeon.
boy: May I see Fang now?
this: Alright, I'll tell my guard to stand down.
this: Hey Leopold!
Leopold: What?
this: Stand down.
Leopold: Okay.
this: Hello, Boyle.
boy: I was a fool all those years ago!
boy: I was so driven by my own ego that I was blinded to what I really wanted! 
boy: Now, I'm not going to run away anymore. Today, I know more than I ever have in my life, all I really  want is ... 
this: Yes ...
boy: I really want to rule Tor!
boy: To that end, I think we should get married.
this: You had me at ^I ^really ^want ^to ^rule ^Tor!
this: We can rule it together!
boy: I suppose that will have to do.
ing-w: ^Noooooooooooo! My ^curse! It's ^broken!!!
boy-h: Really?
ing-x: No, of course it isn't. If you marry her, your skin will off. And so will hers. 
this: Sorry, Boyle. I like my skin.
this: Nope.

Event 32: S.Innkeeper
this: Need a room?
this: Head upstairs when you're ready.
boy: We need a room for the night.
boy: The mystic has a prediction for us tomorrow.
this: Ooh! That's exciting!
this: I tell you what, I'll let you stay for free.
mys: Thank you.

boy: That was a good sleep.

vn-ing-a: We'll use the potion!
vn-ing-a: I'm not dragging anymore bodies around.
ing: Drink this.
this: Hmmm, that's nice.
ing: Thanks, I brewed it myself.
this: So, shall we have a game of two card flip?
ing: No, you're going to prison now.
this: I am?
ing: Yes, please lock the door afterwards.
this: Of course.

Event 21: S.Mayor's Daughter
this: I'm the mayor's daughter.
this: I love my pretty Wolfy!
boy-h: Do you mind if I take a look at Wolfy for a second? 
this: No! My Wolfy! Mine!
23: Is there a problem here?
boy-w: No! No problem. We're just talking.
this: ^My wolfy!
boy-a: ^Fine! Listen, ^kid, what do you want for him? I'll give you anything in the world. 
this: ... anything?
boy: Yes, whatever you want.
this: Hummmm ...
this: Bring me a ^prettier pet!
boy-a: Prettier than Wolfy- I mean Fang!? Such a creature does not exist. 
boy: No, you're right ... I'll find you something better.
boy: How about a beautiful ^white wolfy?
mys-a: Boyle!
this: I want an exotic pet! Not some mutt from the Tor managerie! 
boy: Sure.
this: I want an exotic pet from another continent!
boy: Just wait here. I'll bring you something.
mys-c: You're not going to just take Fang?
boy: I don't want to deal with the mayor of Tor.
boy: Just wait here. I'll bring you something.
this: I'm getting bored of Wolfy!
boy: What would you like instead?
this: I want something extra-ordinary!
this: From another continent.
boy: I'll find you something extraordinary.
this: I want something extra-ordinary!
this: From another continent.
boy: I'll find you something extraordinary.
boy: Hey, little girl. I found you a frog prince!
this: Hummm ...
z-this: Okay!
this: You can have Wolfy back.
this: He pooped on the floor.
this: I love Froggy.
boy: I love Wolfy.

Event 8: EV008

mys: Use your other senses to guide you.
ing-a: I'm not a dog, I don't have any other senses!

Fangder: I'm dead.
boy2-c: ... huh?
boy2-c: How did I get here?
mys2: You were kidnapped by Fangder.
mys2: Ingrid was very worried about you.
boy2-c: ^Really?
ing2-w: I was worried about my house!
ing2-a: It's made of ^gingerbread in case you forgot!
ing2-a: It won't last one week in the humidity of that mist! 
boy2: Okay. That makes more sense.
mys2-c: But Ingrid, you said-
ing2-a: Enough gossip! Let's get Boyle down.
boy3: So what happened with the mist queen? Did she clear the mist? 
mys2-s: ...
mys2-s: Yes, but she could no longer feel Fang's presence. 
boy3-a: What do you mean!?
mys2-s: Fang escaped the mist. He is likely wandering somewhere on the mainland. 
boy3-s: He must be looking for me!
ing2: Don't forget we still have to get to the shadow lands. 
boy3: We'll head to Tor. We'll have a chance to look for Fang on the way, and we can get a boat once  we get there. 
boy3: We can get there by going through the Briar Woods.

ing: You been hiding from me, Boyle?
boy-a: ^Hiding? $w.30 Why would I be hiding? I'm the most powerful one here! 
ing: Maybe at one time, but now you're just as weak as the rest of us retired villains. 
ing: Where is the mir wood, Wolfbane? We need it to start the ceremony! 
boy-w: Oh, the mir wood? I can explain ...
ing-s: Why did I ever curse you to marry me? In half a year we'll be stuck together forever. 
boy: Look on the bright side. Have any of your spells ever worked? 
boy-s: Come on, Ingrid! Do you have any idea how difficult it is to get mir wood from those trees? 
ing-x: No, I don't. Because we always send you. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. 
ing: It should be no problem for somebody as powerful as yourself. 
ing: You always like to let us all know how successful you ^almost were. 
ing: I'll meet you back here when you're done.
boy: Fine, come on Fang.

Event 7: U.Fang

boy: Any new ideas?
this: It bears a resemblance to some of the pumpkins here in Wyrmwood. 
this: They could very well hold the key to this puzzle. Maybe literally. 
this: But their shells are almost as hard to crack as the riddle of the giant pumpkin. 
this: Help me get inside and I promise to share the splendor of whatever it is that lurks inside. 
boy: I suppose I could dismantle a few pumpkins.
this: I'm close ... oh, I'm so close.

Event 81: U.pumpers
boy: It's a pumpkin.

Event 37: EV037
boy: I can't leave, I'm collecting tickets.
boy-c: What's going on here? That mist ... where did it come from? 
ing4: It came down from the Mist Mountains.
34: What is that!?
boy-w: Fang!
35: I wouldn't go in there if I were you!
35: Few have ever returned from the Myst Mountains. 
boy-a: None have ever ^entered  the Myst Mountains.
35: Which is why they're still with us.
boy: I don't care what happens. That's my dog. I'm going after him. 
ing4: Boyle, WAIT!
boy: Don't worry about me, Ingrid. I'll be fine.
ing4-a: The mir wood, Boyle! Give it to me.
boy-w: Oh ... right.
1: Should we try to stop him? It's surely dangerous up in those mountains. 
ing4: He'll be fine.
35: Fang entered the Myst Mountains and he hasn't returned! 
ing4-a: He's been gone for ^one minute.
35: Ravens perceive time differently to humans ...
ing4-h: Enough of this. Who's up for some mir-roasted marshmallows? 
35: ...
ing4-a: What now? 
35: Ravens perceive marshmallows differently to humans. 

Event 73: EV073
19: You take another step, Boyle Wolfbane, and I'll turn you into a toadfish! 
18: Yes, with big lips, so we can ^kiss you!
boy-w: I wasn't going to go in! I swear!
20: She's just joking. $w.30 We'd make your lips ^smaller, if anything. 
boy-w: Just inspecting the gingerwork!

Event 105: S.Vanesssa
this: My grumpy husband never comes out of the crypt for these events. 

Event 85: EV085
89: Ingrid was supposed to put those things ^away!
89: The raven lord's not going to be happy about that.
89: Right, Boyle, time to collect the critters.
boy: I'm busy.
89: Help me round them up and I'll give you my tickets.
89: Come on, they're hanging out near the fireworks.
89: I'll be waiting.

Event 9: EV009
10: Oh, hey Boyle! You wanna play apple bobbing?
boy: No, Payne, $w.20 ^I $w.20 still have my self respect ... even if everybody else here has lost  theirs. 
10: You can win some tickets.
boy-h: I can win tickets?
10: You can buy yourself another one of those fancy gargoyles if you win enough. 
boy-c: Hmmm ...
boy: I mean, gargoyles ^are rather $n sinister ...
boy: And if I only bob as a means of obtaining the gargoyle, I'm not really compromising my integrity ... in  a way. 

Event 91: Elzabeth2
this: Good work, Boyle.
this: A smashing good time.

Event 33: EV033
boy: Ingrid is probably in that direction.

Event 29: U.Raven
103: Hello, Boyle.
boy-a: Why do you have so many birds!?
103: I'm the raven lord ...

Event 2: S.Ophela
this: Get away from me Boyle! I know what you're up to! I've been cultivating this pumpkin garden for an  entire year! 
boy: What am I going to do to it?
this: Don't think I haven't noticed Sid Riddle looking at my pumpkin garden with that amber glow in his eyes! 
this: You're always scheming with him. I can tell when you've got pumpkin on the brain. 
this: I adore every single pumpkin in this garden!

Event 20: S.Edith
this: Those do-gooders just don't give up.
this: Maybe their pet store is getting empty. Ha ha ha ha ha ha! 

Event 108: EV108

Event 43: EV043
Hughbert2: We're doomed!
61: The mist has swallowed my house!
42: I'm wanted on three continents. I have nowhere else to go! 
ing5: Calm down everyone.
60: Look!
60: Boyle's returned from the mist!
40: He's alive!
boy: I come bearing news. Someone stole the Mist Queen's youngest son. 
41: Oh ...
41: Is she mad?
boy: Well, she covered the town in mist.
41: So ...
boy: She threatened to cover the whole world in mist if he isn't found soon. 
boy: Worse, Fang is still lost in the mist. 
boy: Unless we can find her son, he could die in there. 
boy: Oh, and us too.
Hughbert2: Are you suggesting that ^one ^of ^us does the work of a hero? 
sys: Sounds of horror and dismay ripple through the crowd. 
boy: If we're to save Fang and the village, we'll need to go to Aveyond and ask for help from the Oracle. 
41: Oh dear! Poor Arabella has fainted!
boy: Oh, come on people. We're ^retired! She's not going to do anything to us. 
boy: So who's going to go?
Elzabeth8: A knight cut off my toe! I'd never survive the journey. 
Raven Lord8: The impenetrable mist ... it's kind of pretty!  
Raven Lord8: I'm sure we'll manage living with it ... somehow. 
61: I left a potion on the stove! If I don't get back to it soon, it might turn into chicken stew. 
boy-a: Oh, come on people! How can you be afraid of a frail old woman? 
boy: Fine, if none of you are brave enough, ^I'll go to the oracle! 
42: That's mighty brave of you, Boyle!
60: We support you one thousand percent, Boyle.
boy-a: Cowards!
boy-s: I'll save you Fang, even if I have to beg the blasted Oracle for help on my own. 

Event 4: EV004
boy: I'm not scared of her, I just don't feel like talking to her right now. 

Event 74: U.pumpers
boy: It's a pumpkin.

Event 31: EV031
boy: She'd never look for us in her own house!
Fang: ...
boy: You think it's a bad idea? Fine.

Event 5: 
boy2: Look at these fools, Fang.
boy2: Dancing around, acting so jovial ...
boy2-a: They're making a mockery of what it means to be a villain! 
boy2-s: It's no wonder they never got anywhere.
boy2-s: And look at us, Fang ... former legends, living out our days amongst the rest of them.  
Fang: Woof.
z-x-ing2-a: Boyle Wolfbane!
boy2-w: Uh oh!
ing2: Boyle Wolfbane! Where are you hiding?
ing2-a: If you're in there and you don't open up, I'm going to knock your house down! 
ing2: Unless the wind beats me to it!
vn-ing-x: Ha ha ha ha!
Fang: Whimpers.
boy2: Don't worry Fang, she doesn't know any spells. 
boy2-w: Fang, she must have heard you!
boy2-a: If she knocks over my gargoyle we're going to have a problem. 

Event 16: S.Laguna Le Rouge
this: Guess which bucket contains a ticket and they can all be yours! 
this: Choose incorrectly ... and you must surrender  all your tickets to me. 
boy-c: That seems a bit unfair.
this: Yeah, I suppose. But you see, there's this gargoyle statue ... 
boy: I've heard enough. You're on.
this: Good. Choose wisely. But please don't.
boy: Fang, where are the tickets?
boy: What is it, Fang?
boy-h: Well, well ... what have we here?
boy: Good job Fang. I never would have guessed he had them tucked away ^behind ^his ^caravan. 
this: $w.25 $s.1 Ah $w.25 heh $w.25 heh ... $s.3
this: Please, Boyle! I'm sorry. Don't take my tickets.
boy: Sorry Bertrand, but there's this gargoyle ...
this: I guess I'll never own that gargoyle now.

Event 30: U.Vamps
boy: It seems everybody is attending the festival.

Event 47: EV047
boy: I'm not leaving while there's a party happening.

Event 10: S.Payne
this: Care for some apple bobbing?
boy: Let's get this over with. What do I have to do?
this: Just grab an apple out of the tank with your  mouth. If you find the green one, you'll win some  tickets! 
boy-c: That's all I have to do? Are you serious?
this: I'm surprised, I would have thought you'd consider yourself above sticking your head in water. 
boy-h: Oh, but I do.
boy-h: Fang.
Fang: Bark!
boy: Good job Fang, you can eat it if you want.
this: Oh, that's actually the only $end
boy: What were you saying?
this: Never mind ...
this: Here you go.
this: I guess the fun's over now.

Event 26: T.Ingrid's House
boy: If I'm trying to hide from Ingrid I probably should be near her house.

boy: It's a pumpkin.

Event 69: U

Event 119: EV119
91: Time to send them back to the demon realm.

this: Phye!? What brings you here.
phy: The time to complete my blade has come.
this: Are you sure that's such a good idea?
phy: Yes, I've found some helpers.
this: Alright, if you say so.
this: Don't complain to me if they can't handle the heat. 
mys-w: Did he say ... ^heat?
mys: It's not really that hot, though, is it?
phy: It's scorching.
mys-w: I can't go in there, I'll dry up!
hib-w: Now that mention it, I'm carrying a lot of valuable scrolls and information ... 
boy: Don't worry, I will brave the depths of the heat like a true fighter. 
mys-a: You're a ^fire mage, you won't even feel it!
boy: I'd go in even if I wasn't!
rob-a: I'm coming down either way!
boy: So, what about you, Ingrid?
ing-c: ...
ing: I can't have well have you showing me up, can I Boyle?

Event 1: EV001
boy2: I'm going to remove the bag now. Be careful, he may be violent.  
boy2: If he resists the brainwashing, we'll have to resort to more drastic measures. But let's hope it  doesn't come to that. 
rob2: Oh ... hi guys! Are you the ones who kidnapped me? 
boy2: Silence! We require your powers for our own purposes. Do as we say and no harm  will come to  you! 
mys2-a: You said we weren't going to force anything on him! 
boy2-s: Oh, right. Sorry.
rob2-h: Sounds like fun! What are we doing?
ing2-c: He seems a little too ^enthused, doesn't he?
boy2-c: Yes ...
boy2: Do you understand you were shoved in a bag and brought into a strange place? 
rob2-c: I've always thought of her as more eclectic than strange. 
boy2-c: ... come again?
rob2-h: This is my nan's house! I've been living here while she's on holiday. 
mys2: This one is not like the others. He is just a boy.
rob2-w: No, no! I'm a paladin! I swear!
boy2: It doesn't matter, all paladins are the same.
rob2-w: He's right! We're all the same! And we have the same powers!  
rob2: There's absolutely no point in kidnapping somebody else. 
boy2: So you can do ^anything a normal paladin could do? 
rob2-h: Absolutely!
boy2: Fine, you'll do. Although I find your acceptance disturbing. 
rob2: Since we're going to be working together from now on, I think we should introduce ourselves. 
rob2: I'm Robin ... ummm, I'm a paladin. But you already knew that. That's why you kidnapped me  after all. 
rob2-h: A fantastic choice you will ^not regret, by the way! 
rob2: So who's going next?
boy2-a: ...
ing2: I'm not good at introductions. I'm more of a ^goodbye kind of person. 
rob2: That's funny, I'm the opposite of that!
ing2: Fine, may as well get this over with.
ing2: My name is Ingrid. This is my future husband, Boyle. We're on a quest to save the world and find a  perfect wedding venue. 
rob2-h: That's amazing! So what was the proposal? Ring hidden in food?  
ing2-h: Curse.
rob2-c: Hmmm ... I've never heard of that before, but it sounds cool. 
ing2-h: Trust me, it was a very ^enchanting proposal!
ing2-x: Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
rob2: I would have gone for ring hidden in food myself. 
rob2: It must be great going on such  an adventure with somebody you love. 
boy2: Actually, she's insufferable.
rob2: So what about you, quiet girl?
mys2-c: ...
boy2: She's still trying to figure you out.
boy2: She's a strange one. Doesn't really say much.
boy2: But she can always find her voice when she's got something rude to say. 
boy2: Which is surprisingly often.
rob2: Nice to meet you, ummm ... I didn't catch you name. 
mys2: Myst.
rob2-c: Miss ...
mys2: Myst. With a T.
rob2-h: Of course! Miss Myst!
mys2: You are not like other men.
rob2-s: So I've been told ...
mys2: Your predisposition to anger is not immediately apparent. 
rob2-c: Well I haven't been told that before.
boy2: That's enough introductions. Robin, accompany us to the princess's chambers. 
rob2-h: You mean I get to see inside the castle!?
rob2: New friends, a new adventure ... this is fast turning into the best day ever! 
rob2-w: Not that this sort of thing doesn't happen all the time! You know, since I'm a paladin ... 
boy2-a: I'm not your friend. Our relationship is one of minion and master $w.30 ^at ^best! 
rob2-h: Of course!

Event 16: EV016
7: Rowen? Is that you?
7: You found a way to break the curse!
7: We all knew the mystic made a poor decision.
7: If anybody was crafty enough to break the curse, we knew it would be you! 
row2: It was my friends that broke the curse.
7: I am very pleased! We owe you much, friends of Rowen. 
7: If there is anything you need of me, do not hesitate to ask. 
row2: Actually, we were hoping to ask you something. We would like to take the Rickety Biscuit. 
7: That old thing? Whatever do you need it for?
row2: It's complicated, but it involves a blood moon, some mist, and a whole lot of adventure. 
mys2-h: Adventure!
7: We have no use for a ship. It is yours.
ing2: See Boyle, sometimes all you need to do is ask.
boy-w: I didn't hear any objections to my plan at the time! 
15: Now hold on one second, King!
row2-s: Miles ...
15: That boat is part of our history. We've no idea what secrets it could hold. 
7: If anybody's going to figure that out, it's Rowen.
15: You would have our history sail off into the sunset with some vagabond we may likely never see  again? 
rob2-a: Hey! Don't talk to Rowen like that!
row2-a: Robin, don't get involved.
row2-s: I'm sorry to ask such a thing, Miles. I only ask because of the blood - 
15: We don't care about any blood moons or prophecies.  
15: We keep to ourselves, we won't make the same mistakes as our ancestors. 
7: That's enough, Crudes. We've turned our backs on the relics of the past. 
7: After what happened to our ancestors, it's best we keep as far away from them as possible. 
7: Rowen, you may take the ship, and you would be doing us a great service by doing so. 
15: She deserves nothing. She's not one of us anymore! 
rob2-a: It sounds like she's done a lot more for these people than you ever have! 
row2-s: We should leave.

Event 35: EV035
hib5: Oh ... good morning everybody.
hib5: Did everyone sleep well?
ing5-a: Not as well as you.
hib5: I have a specific herbal tea I think could help you with that. 
ing5-a: I can see why those little people were quickly driven to violence. 
hib5-w: Did I do something wrong?
hib5: Please, I mean no harm.
ing5: And yet everywhere you go, people want to hurt you. 
hib5-w: Yikes! $w.30 I guess I'm not quite as well-read on human interaction as I thought I was. 
row: Let's speak to the king. I should be able to convince him to give up the boat pretty easily. 
hib: Before we go, could I have a quick word with you about something Rowen? 
ing: There'll be time for talking later. You shouldn't have overslept. 

Event 19: Visit Ron about BOY
20: What are you doing here?
row2-s: I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused. I really wanted to avoid all of this. 
20: Of course you did, you avoid everything.
row2-s: Please Miles ...
row2-s: Can I see him?
20: Why? So you can leave again?
20: Are you really that selfish that you would do that to him? 
row2-a: I wasn't going to come in, but he's having nightmares. 
20: Only because he went snooping around in those vaults! I told you we never should have gone in there. 
row2: He's been corrupted. Hi'beru can heal him, but only if you let us. 
20: I'm the one who's supposed to protect him! I'm the one who stayed! 
row2-s: You do protect him. But this is my fault, let me fix it. 
20: Fine.
20: But I want you to leave as soon as you're done.
row2-s: ...
row2: Hey there buddy.
18: Who are you?
row2: I'm ...
row2: I'm just ... an adventurer.
18: Really? My mom is an adventurer too! Have you met her? 
row2: I ... could have. What does she look like?
18: My dad says she was the most beautiful elf in TOWNNAME. 
18: She is busy saving the world all the time, so she never gets to come home. 
18: I'm going to be an adventurer when I get big too. 
18: Then I'm going to find my mom and help her save the world! 
18: Why are you crying? Are you sad?
row-s: Oh ... it's nothing.
row2: Listen, if you want to be an adventurer, you have to be brave. 
18: I'm brave.
row2: You have to be ready at a moment's notice. 
row2: The call to adventure always comes when you least expect it. 
18: I'm always ready!
row2-x: Well then, would you like to go an adventure with me right now? 
18: Really!?
row2: I'm going somewhere very scary and I need somebody brave to come along and keep me safe. 
18: I go on scary adventures all the time, but always when I'm asleep ... 
row2: Sometimes those are the most dangerous adventures of all. 
row2-h: Come on, let's go.
20: Wait a minute, Rowen.
20: I need to know why you did it.
row2-c: Did what?
20: That curse wasn't intended for you, but you just happened to get in the way at the last second. 
20: I never understood why you did it.
row2-s: I had to leave anyway. There's too much out there in the world to see. 
row2: My call to adventure came sooner than I had hoped, but I had to take it. 
row2: If it meant I could save somebody else from a life of slavery at the same time, all the better. 
20: Did you even think about me?
row2-a: Of course I did!
row2-s: All those days we spent exploring the vaults. I thought we'd live a life of adventure together. 
row2-s: But after the wedding everything changed, you changed.  
row2-s: I thought I could change too, but I couldn't.
row2-s: I didn't want this life. I thought we'd explore the world just like we did the vaults. 
20: The vaults ... I always hated those cursed halls.
row2-s: Then why did you explore them with me? 
20: Why do you think?
row2-s: I'm sorry it turned out like this.
20: So am I.

Event 17: S.Miles2
this: What do you want now, Rowen?
row: Why did you lock the vault, Miles?
this: Monsters. Hellspawn.
row: What!?
this: They came for the ancient secrets, so I locked them in there.  
this: I told you nothing good would come from digging up the past. 
row: Could you just give me the key? We need to find something on the Rickety Biscuit. 
this: You've caused enough trouble digging through those vaults. 
this: I won't expose our people to the curses of the past just so you can disappear with our ship!  
this: They might all trust you but I don't.
row: So be it.
hib-x: And how are you sleeping?
ing-a: No!
hib-x: Ouch! I'm sorry!
ing-a: You're still doing it!
hib-x: I'm sorry ... hey!
ing-h: Well why didn't you stop?
hib-s: I thought I sensed something.
ing: Keep it to yourself. You give people the creeps doing that. 
row-s: Forget it, let's go.

1: Ahhh, and Phye has also returned!
1: You may have slipped your chains the first time, but I assure you it won't happen again. 
phy2: We've been through more trials throughout the years than you could ever know! 
phy2-h: If you really think some enslavement trick will be the end of us, you're in for a rude awakening! 
phy2: You may be powerful.
phy2-x: But you chose the wrong race to enslave!
1: Phye ... spare me ... show mercy.
1: Phye ... you are not a vengeful race.
1: I am defeated. I pose no further threat.
1: Your kind ... you do not kill for nothing.
phy2: You're right. I'm not going to kill you for nothing.
1: Thank you-
phy2-h: I'm going to kill you for your essence.
phy2: This sword is the Draghar's greatest creation.
phy2: With each demon I kill, it will grow more powerful. 
phy2: And I promise I will not stop killing until I rid the world of each and every one of your kind. 
phy2: The Draghar are not a vengeful race, but there is a reason we are everlasting. 
vn-phy-x: I can feel the power!
sys: Phye learned a new move.
ing2-w: Heh ... I'm glad he's on our side.
phy2: The curse on our town has been lifted. 
phy2: I could not have done this without your help.
phy2: Not just myself, but all Draghar's are now indebted to you. 
hib2: You know, we'll likely come across more demons in our travels. 
hib2: You can come with us if you like.
phy2: Thank you for the offer.
phy2: Of course I would be glad to come along.
mys2: You're a lot kinder than your rough exterior suggests. 
phy2: All draghar's are kind. It's just this world that has made us tough. 
phy2: Let's go see this Skull Mountain barriet now.

Gimble: An escape plan has been devised and is already in action. 
mys-h: Great! What is it?
Gimble: I've been gnawing away at those steel bars a bit each day. 
Gimble: I can only do it for so long before I pass out.
mys-s: Oh my ...
Gimble: Now, with you here, we can gnaw at them twice as fast! 
Gimble: A few solid days of effort and we'll be free! 
mys-s: I ... guess ...
mys: Actually, I've got a better plan.
Gimble: Better than mine? I doubt it.
mys: Throw me over the bars. Once I'm out, I'll get the key and release you. 
Gimble: I'm not a troll, I couldn't throw you that high.
Gimble: And I don't know why you think there would be a key in here. 
mys: I'm a mist wraith, I'm very light. And the key is just over there. 
Gimble: I don't see anything. How can you tell?
mys: I'm a creature of the forest. I have heightened senses. 
Gimble: You weave an interesting tale, I'll give you that. 
Gimble: I know I have no reason to trust you, but the idea of tossing you over that cage excites me. 
Gimble: I've long looked upon those trolls with childish wonder, imagining what it must be like ... 
Gimble: Let's do it.
Gimble: I did it!
mys: I'll get you out.

Event 3: S.Gimble

Event 33: EV033
18: There are ... so many. 
18: I don't understand, this was supposed to be a surprise attack. 
25: There must be a traitor among us!
18: Never mind! All they've done is made it easier for us to find the demons! 
19: This ... isn't really what I was expecting.
27: Yes, it's rather quite miserable here, isn't it?
24: Come to think of it, the demons never really bothered me in the first place. 
19: Let's return to the boat and hightail it out of here!
27: Here here!
18: ^Cowards! $w.20 Dare thee skulk from thy quest? 
18: These demons have taken so much from us! 
18: Parents, siblings, children ... they don't discriminate. 
18: Today we show them that though they may take our lives ... 
18: They will ^never take our pride!
24: I saw we leave our pride here and escape with our lives! 
27: Here here!
rob2-w: Hold on a second, fellers! What about the oaths we all swore? 
ing2: Well, so much for the paladins ...
boy2: To be honest, I'm surprised we even got them off the boats to begin with. 
1: Come to me, Boyle ...
18: A traitor. On my own ship! I can't believe we didn't see it. 
rob2: It's not your fault. Don't blame yourself.
1: Boyle, come closer.
boy2-a: I will never obey a demon!
1: Of course you won't. Now lay down your weapons. 
boy2: Of course ...
18: Boyle, look out!
18: Snap out of it, Boyle! $w.30 We have to stick together if we've any chance of defeating them.

Event 1: S.Mariette
this: Greetings!
boy: I take it I've found the ferry.
this: Indeed you have! This ferry is headed straight for Whisper Woods. 
boy: I'm just a normal, unassuming man who requires passage on this ferry. 
boy: Can you accomodate me?
this: ...
this: You sound a typical passenger, so I don't really see any problem with it. 
this: But no, I'm afraid I can't.
boy-c: You're refusing me access to the ferry? On what grounds? 
this: I'm not the ferryman, partner. I'd be ill-equipped to handle a vessel such as this. 
boy-a: Why didn't you say that in the first place?
this: I thought I would hear you out.
this: Ray and his boys went in to the Briar Woods yesterday. 
this: Something to do with reclaiming their possessions from the goblins. 
this: ... but they never returned.
boy:  Sounds like they got into trouble. I'll go look for  him. 
this: You some kind of hero or something?
boy-w: Hey, calm down. I'm just a normal, unassuming guy, remember? 
this: Well ... the Briar Woods are just south of Windshire. But it's very dangerous there. 
this: I hope Ray returns soon, I left my covey balm in Whisper Woods. 

Event 5: EV005
ing2: Hi, I'd like to board the ferry to Whisper Woods.
Ray: How many passengers?

Event 9: EV009
boy2-h: Ahhh, it feels great having a dungeon again!
mys: Boyle, I'm worried you may be slipping back into your old ways. 
boy2: We can't trust him not to run back to his master, Scar. 
boy2: Best to just keep him here for the time being.
4: A splendid plan! I will sit and ruminate over my decision to tend a store on my own! 
boy2: We'll set you free after we've sorted out this business with the shop. 
4: You should take this.
boy2: Thanks a lot.
4: Welcome.

Event 1: S.row2
this: I'm rowen.

Event 3: S.Mystic
this: I may or may not be the mystic.
this: Do you have the money?
boy: Not yet.
this: Do you have the money?
boy: I didn't know being a hero came with so many sacrifices. 
this: Thank you. Please understand I request this gold only as a deterrent. 
this: Every future scenario that I ^don't have to reveal is a greater profit to me. 
row2: Then why did you offer that guy a two-for-one deal yesterday? 
this: I thought I told you to tone down that sass!
this: ... it looked like I was losing him, and my mystic powers told me he really needed to see the future.  $w.60 Twice. 
row2: Are you sure? Because that new rug tells a different story. 
this: You can't see the horrors that go on inside my mind! You don't know what I go through! 
ing-a: So you were telling us about this guard that watches the boat! 
this: Hmmm, let's see. Okay, he's going to have an accident. Let's say ... tomorrow. Yeah, tomorrow's  good. 
this: Why don't you go have a sleep at the inn and head there just after sunrise? 
this: A structural weakness will render him ineffective for a short time. 
ing: Just after sunrise? Ugh, I hate getting up early.
this: Oh, did I say just after sunrise? Sorry, the vision was cloudy ... it's actually a bit later. Around the time  you wake up. 
ing: That's perfect!
this: You won't come across predictions this accurate anywhere else. $w.30 They wear on me   terribly! 
row2: And me!
this: Quiet, you!
ing-c: What's she talking about?
this: Half the time I don't understand myself. She's not from here, you know? I rescued her. 
this: Elves are very difficult to trainn. Never get one.
mys-c: ^Get one?
this: Mentor! Never mentor one. Too much sass.
row2: So get a different one.
this: I went through enough to get you!
this: She has an attitude problem, as you can tell. I've been trying to fix her, but it's proving difficult. 
mys: If you can see into the future, why didn't you know you wouldn't like her? 
this: And use my powers for personal gain? I would never! 
ing: We should be going now.
row2: Bye, guys. Good luck!
boy: Bye ...
this: I knew you would return.

Event 14: S.Marchy
this: Looking back, this wasn't my best decision.

Event 12: EV012

ing: Sure, how about this ... how many mystics am I going to ^expose today? 
3: Well, let's see ... wait! What are you talking about?
ing: Here you go, Rowen. Catch.
row2-h: Thanks a lot, guys!
3: What is the meaning of this?
ing: We found about the little scam you were running. We've just ^cured Rowen! 
3: ^What!? How ^dare you?
3: That's ^my apprentice! I paid GOOD MONEY for her! 
row2-x: Well, it's been an interesting experience. I unlearned a lot, but it's time to move on. 
row2: No hard feelings, alright?
ing: I guess your mystic days are over. But you could always work in our store, sweeping cobwebs. 
ing: We've got a few spiders in the attic. It's not that glamorous, but hey, it could to other things. 
3: Insolent ^fools!
3: You think I needed  ^HER to be all-knowing ... all ^powerful? 
ing: Well, yes.
3: I need ^NOBODY!
3: You haven't seen the last of me! I will have my revenge! 
3: I see ^bad ^things in your future, Miss Ingrid. ^Very bad things! 
ing-h: And what about Boyle and I? Will we still get married? 
3: I can say with ^certainty that YOU WILL NOT!
row2: Well then ... shall we leave Tor?
rob: Do you think he meant what he said about us not having seen the last of him? 
boy: Of course not. He was just keeping up appearances. 
boy: It's what I'd have done.
ing: Don't worry, Robin, I can say with certainty that this chapter in our lives is officially ^over. 
row2-h: I can't wait to put Tor behind me!

Event 11: EV011
row2: Hi guys!
3: Ahhh, you have returned. I hope seeing into the future did not cause you too much trouble. 
boy: Actually, we've come to ask for your help again. This time it will be a lot easier. 
3: Seeing into the future is never easy, but it is my cross to bear, so I don't complain. 
boy: We're looking for the ends of the earth. Do you have any idea how we might get there. 
3: I'm sorry, my talents - logic defying as they may be - are limited in scope. 
3: I can barely see beyond the outskirts of Tor, let alone the ends of the earth. 
3: Simply, what you are asking me to do is impossible. 
row2-x: Hmmm, the ends of the earth ... I've heard of that place. 
row2: You can get there through a little alcove in the Black Briar Woods. 
boy-w: Really?
row2: Yeah.
3: That will be 500 gold!
mys-a: For what? You didn't do anything!
3: You've taken information from me. You are indebted. 
mys: But we didn't even -
3: ^Silence! $w.30 Pay up or I will ^tell ^you ^how ^you ^die! 
boy-w: Yikes! We better pay up!

Event 15: S.Rudey
this: I liked my old prison better.

Event 2: EV002
ing: So ... are you this powerful mystic we've been hearing about? 
row2: Yeah, he's the one.
3: Rowen! Silence!
3: That depends. Have you come seeking insight ... or vengeance? 
ing: Both, if possible.
mys: Just insight, actually.
3: Good, never can be too sure. If I'd known I'd make so many enemies doing- 
3: Anyway!
3: So ... you wish to know what the future holds?
ing: We hear that people always get a good reading from you. 
ing: There's always a guard at the port. We need to know if and when it will be unattended. 
3: Hmmm ... so it is entrance to the port you seek.
3: Very well, I can tell you this. But first I must warn you ... 
3: The blinds of fate are not so easily parted, you see. 
3: And it is never without consequence that I am able to predict what the future holds. 
3: To be able to see  the future, before it happens, is more power than any man should truly ever have. 
3: Or ^want.
3: Before I can do this, I need to know that you understand the true cost of what it is you're asking  me to do today. 
ing: Yeah, yeah, we understand. Besides, if we don't save the world, it will hardly matter. 
3: Yes, but do you know ... the ^true cost?
ing-c: ...
boy-c: ...
mys-c: ...
row2: He wants you to pay him.
3: Rowen! Tone down that sass.
3: Don't listen to her, she's my apprentice, I've been trying to train her. 
3: But yes, I do require money.
boy: Of course.
3: The cost will be 1000 gold. Speak to me when you have it.

6: Let's hope we're able to summon him.
6: I must warn you, I'm still very weak.
6: Boyle, I won't be able to protect you in this battle.
boy2-a: Why are you only telling ^me that!?
mys2-h: Probably because last time all you did was stand there like a lost puppy. 
boy2: I was being mind-controlled by Bahl!
6: I'm going to try the summon now ...
7: What is the meaning of this?
rob-a: We've got you now, you traitor!

7: $s.3 You look like you're almost dead already.
7: No matter, Bahl has made me one of his captains.
7: That means I no longer need to count on silly poisons to get the job done. 
7: I will just finish you off ^right ^now!
6: $s.1 To accept such evil power so readily ...
6: What happened to you, father?
7: $s.3 I grew tired of struggling, that's all.

6: $s.1 You're right.
7-c: $s.3 I'd say you've also gained some respect forme, having seen me in action. 
6: $s.1 Oh, I'm sorry, I was only semi-conscious.
boy2-w: $s.3 You mean you didn't see me fight!?
6: $s.1 I apologize.
6: Hey, maybe one day when I've recovered, we can have a sparring match. 
boy2-s: $s.1 ... fine.
6: $s.1 For now, I think I'm going to take a holiday.
rob2-h: $s.3 Where to?
6: $s.1 Someplace peaceful where I can recover.
6: $s.1 Away from the stress.
6: $s.1 But before I go, I think there's something I can teach you. 
sys: $s.3 Boyle's alertness in battle increased.
6: $s.1 Until we meet again.
boy2: $s.3 I hope she recovers soon.
boy2-h: Because when she does, she's going to be in for a world of hurt!

ing2: You never know when you're going to need a nice sacrificial dagger, or stone potion. Why not be  ready? 
boy2: If I need something, I can get it. I want to know that I can still get things done without a stockpile of  equipment when I need to. 
boy2: Besides, I have nowhere to put that kind of stuff. I don't want my house to turn into a dump like  yours. 
rob2: Here is the list of paladins you requested!

ing-h: Trust me, I'd know!
ing-x: Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
boy: Fine, if you get to wait outside, so do I.
ing: What do you want to wait outside for?
boy: I ... feel uneasy around royalty.
boy: Robin and Myst can handle this.
rob-a: We won't let you down!

Event 3: EV003
Guard: Halt! Who goes there?
boy: We need to speak to the king.
Guard: He's not in a good mood at the moment. His daughter has been taken ill. 
Guard: But ...
Guard: If you really must speak to him, I'd recommened bringing him a gift. 
Guard: That always seems to lift his spirits.
boy: What does he like?
Guard: I haven't figured it out myself yet.
Guard: Maybe try asking the other guards around town. 
Guard: If you happen to find out what he likes, would you let me me know? 
Guard: I need to request permission to leave my post.
Guard: I have an appointment with the wedding planner next week. 
Guard: Halt! Who goes there?
Guard: Did you find a gift for the king?
boy: No.
Guard: Then I don't recommend going in there.
Guard: Halt! Who goes there?

Event 5: EV005
Mist Queen: Daughter, have you news of the youngest? 
mys3: He is being held in the shadow lands. Boyle can save him. 
Mist Queen: So he will help us?
mys3: He has one condition. He asks that the mist be cleared up so he can find his pet. 
Mist Queen: Very well, I will clear the mist for the time being, but it can just as easily return. 
Mist Queen: As for his four-legs, I'm afraid he is no longer within my area of influence. 
mys3-c: What do you mean?
Mist Queen: He ventured beyond the mist. I cannot sense him any longer. 
mys3: Boyle will not be happy.
Mist Queen: If he values his home, he will do well to keep on my good side. 
mys3: Have you any idea in which direction the wolf wondered? 
Mist Queen: I covered the island, so he has gone at least as far as the mainland. 
mys3: Very well.
mys3: I will continue to search for the youngest.

Event 3: EV003
Mist Queen: Daughter, have you found the youngest?
boy-a: What did you just $end
mys2: No, mother, but I did find this human.
mys2: His friend, a four-legs, is lost in the mountains. He wishes for you to help him. 
Mist Queen: I have no desire to help this human. It was a human who stole my son. 
boy: What happened to your son? Does this have something to do with the growing mist? 
mys2: A man stole my brother, Whisp, last night. He's only a baby. 
mys2: He won't survive without the mist for long.
Mist Queen: My daughter is correct. I will cover the entire world in mist if I must, to protect him. 
Mist Queen: Leave, human, I cannot stand the sight of you. 
boy: But nothing can survive in this mist you are creating. Many creatures will die! 
Mist Queen: I do not care for the lives of mortal creatures.  
Mist Queen: Unless my son is returned to me, I shall cover the world in a mist so thick that none will  survive. 
boy-s: But ... Fang ...
Mist Queen: That's enough! You had your chance to leave. 
boy-w: I knew it was a trap. I can't see!

Event 47: U.Priestess
this: Oh no, it's terrible!
this: Aveyond is in peril. All of the priestesses must return immediately! 
ing: Why aren't they here already?
this: Three of them were sent out to spread joy and peace, and find potential priestesses. 
this: In times like these, we need to consolidate all of our priestesses in one place. 
this: If you could return them to me, I could bring joy and peace to your own lives. 
ing: Yuck. No thanks.
boy: He ^might be talking about gold. $w.30 Are you talking about gold? 
this: I'm talking about something much greater than gold. 
boy-h: Diamonds?
this: When you get this, you will have no need for gold or diamonds. 
boy: Okay, now I'm interested.
this: The priestesses are spread far and wide. Finding them will not be easy. 
this: They're also trying to keep a low profile, so they will be blending in with the environment. 
this: They're not very good at it though, and will reveal themselves if you talk to them for long enough. 
this: The priestesses are spread far and wide. Finding them will not be easy. 
this: They're also trying to keep a low profile, so they will be blending in with the environment. 
this: They're not very good at it though, and will reveal themselves if you talk to them for long enough. 
boy: We've returned all three priestesses.
this: I am very grateful.
this: Now we will share our knowledge with you.
sys: Boyle gained a stat.
boy-w: What did you do to me?
this: We allowed peace into your heart.
boy: If I start bursting into song or something, you're going to hear from me again. 
this: Hee hee!
this: Please live a good life.

Event 1: U.Aveyonder
ing: What's this supposed to be?
boy-h: It's kind of like a treasure chest.
mys-w: Are you sure that's a good idea, Boyle? 
boy: How could it ^possibly be a bad idea?
ing: Everybody knows how petty these holy beings can be. 
boy-x: What are they going to do, cast a prayer on me? 
ing-x: Ha ha ha ha ha!
mys-h: Hee hee!
Nymph: Thief of Aveyond - be ^blessed!
boy-a: ^Hey! $w.60 What did you just do to me?
Nymph: As punishment for stealing from the goddess's sacred coffers, I ^blessed you to have  bad luck for seven years. 
ing: That sounds more like a curse to me.
Nymph: We don't use that word around here. We are not villains. We bestow blessings, not curses. 
boy: I can't have bad luck for seven years! How am I going to play two-card flip with no luck? 
ing: You never won before you were cursed, so I don't imagine it will make much of a difference. 
boy-a: Nymph, I demand you uncurse me right now! Or face my wrath! 
Nymph: Don't take that tone with me, I'm protected by the goddess so long as I'm in Aveyond. Your threats  are useless here. 
boy-h: Oh really? Is that what you think?
boy: But what if I was to ...
boy-s: Beg?
Nymph: I can't ^unbless you. I'm not a warlock.
Nymph: The only way to remove the blessing  would be to pay back the gold you stole ... 
boy: Well that doesn't seem too - $end
Nymph: To ^ten ^different^ ^donation ^boxes.
boy-w: What!? But there aren't even that many on this ^continent! 
Nymph: Then I suppose you'll have to seek other continents.  
Nymph: Or we could two-card flip for it. But given your predicament, I don't think that's a good idea. Ha  ha. 
boy: You're quite malicious for a holy creature.
Nymph: Return to me once you've made donations to the ten statues, and I'll try to unbless you. 
this: Hi Boyle.

Event 49: S.Ceanna
this: I came home.

Event 8: EV008
mys3: Nice of you to finally join us.

ing3: Let's find the oracle quickly.

boy: I promise.
hib2: So this is what's been haunting you.
boy-s: I never broke my promise to Fang.
hib-x: Until recently.
hib-x: Bahl saw his chance, and corrupted you.
hib-x: But we can bring it to an end right now.
hib-x: It won't be easy, but we'll have to fight him.
boy-w: Fight him!?
boy: Can't you just defeat him?
hib-x: I can only wake him up.
hib-x: If you want the nightmares to end, you have to defeat him at your own game. 
hib-x: I'll do my best to help.
hib-x: And I'm sure Fang would be glad to help you.
boy-h: Let's do it!

Event 8: EV008
boy-a: The wicked wolf!
boy-a: You've taken enough lives!

boy-w: What was that?

Event 2: EV002
boy: Fang! What are you doing back here?
boy-s: Fang? 
boy-s: Fang, please forgive me.

Event 13: EV013
boy-a: Time to die!
4: Very well, Boyle.
4: You have won, but you only defeated my phantom.
4: When we meet for real, I won't be so easily defeated. 
boy-a: I look forward to destroying the real you.
hib-x: We've done it.
hib-x: How do you feel?

Fangder: This time ... you will not escape from Fangder! 

Event 16: EV016
mys2: I do not understand you.
boy-a: Forest spirit!
mys2: No, my name is Myst. Why do you care about the fate of  a four-legs? He's not of your kind. 
boy: I don't care. He is my friend.
boy: Can you ... help?
mys2: My mother might. Would you like to speak to her? 
boy: Where is she?
mys2: Through the mist.
boy: She's a strange one. This could easily be a trap.
boy: But I've set more than a few myself. If that ^is their plan, they're in for a nasty surprise. 

Event 2: U.Fairy

Event 28: EV028

mys-c: Where's Boyle?
ing2-w: He was taken by a giant spider!
mys-w: Oh no!
ing2-s: I tried to turn him into a frog ... but he resisted.

ing2-s: I did everything I could ...

Event 11: S.mys3
vn-mys: That was incredibly silly. You wouldn't have lasted much longer in there. 
vn-boy-a: Cursed mist wraith! Take me back in there now! 
vn-mys-h: But ... you would surely die.
vn-mys: I thought mother was lying when she told embarrassing stories of your kind. 
vn-boy: Fang will die if I don't save him!
vn-mys: Animals aren't as sensitive to the mist. You would die long before Fang. 
vn-mys-c: You would really risk your own life for a ^four-legs? 
vn-mys-h: Such a curious being ...
vn-boy: Fang is my ... friend.
vn-mys-h: Hee hee! But he's just a dog ...
vn-boy: If your useless mist queen's only plan is to sit around and cover Wyrmwood in mist, I guess I'll have  to save that child myself.

ing2-h: Absolutely.
Forthright: ^Heel!
Forthright: Forgive me for not stating my disposition forthrightly, but it is imperative I get the introductions  out of the way first. 
Forthright: I can't have folks drawing the wrong conclusion about me, especially around these parts. 
boy2: Of course not.
Forthright: Thnk of me as a bastion against the dangers of the royal forest. 
Forthright: Beautiful as these sacred grounds are, they are actually bustling with unsavory beings of a  most wicked variety. 
boy2: Yes, I've warned them about the paladins.
Forthright: I have sworn to protect the denizens of the forest at any cost, be it to wealth or wellbeing. 
mys2-c: Interesting ... you would voluntarily put yourself in danger against any odds just to protect  your fellow men ... 
mys2: And yet you ask for nothing in return?
boy2: The ego can be a powerful thing, Myst. $w.45 Sometimes it needs to be fed just as much as the  mouth. 
Forthright: Do not worry, I shall personally ensure that you make it through these woods safely. 
boy: And you know the way?

Forthright: Mutts.

Forthright: Verily! Follow me.
Forthright: Wait out here. Monsters have been known to inhabit this cave. 
Forthright: I, Forthright, will make sure it's safe.
Forthright: After which, I will be promoted to paladin.

Event 7: S.Edgar Highhand
boy: Hey there big guy.
this: What do you lot want?
boy: I see you've registered yourself as a paladin. Well, now the time has come for you to join a  crusade. Are you excited? 
this: No way. I only signed that for the free benefits. I'm not going on any stupid crusades. 
boy: Fine, I guess I'll have to resort to alternative methods. 
boy: I challenge you to a game of ^two ^card ^flip!
ing: No Boyle, you're terrible!
boy: If you lose, you join the crusade!
this: Deal!
9: Bone dragon! I win!
boy3-a: Argh! How could I lose again!? 
boy3: I didn't anticipate such underhanded techniques from a paladin. 
9: That's what they all say! I was a former champion in Tor. 
9: Now ... mow my lawn!
boy3-a: Never!
ing3: Boyle, you can't not fulfill the punishment of a two card flip game! Do you have a deathwish? 
boy3: He cheated!
ing3: That's the entire point of the game.
ing3: Clean up his lawn, then we'll try to convince him some other way. 
ing3: Fine, but I'm going to do a ^very bad job of it.
9: I'm the one with the red mailbox.
this: Clean my lawn!
boy: Your lawn is clean now.
this: Good.
ing: So what should we try next?
rob: ...
rob-a: I challenge you to a game of two card flip!
boy-c; Really? You think you have a chance? You're far too innocent for two card flip. do you even know  how to play? 
rob: I ... have not played before. But it seems fairly straightforward. 
rob-h: And I'm a fast learner!
boy: Two card flip is both extremely simple and endlessly complicated. It's all about cunning,  deception and ingenuity. You'd have no chance. 
rob-s: Come on, let me try!
boy: I guess there's no harm. It will be funny to witness the cruel and unusual punishment. 
rob: I ... ummm ... need to borrow your deck.
boy: ^Never! I spent years building this thing. Do you know how many card shops I've visited around the  world? 
rob-s: But I don't have a deck ...
boy: Fine, you may ^borrow it. But if you beind ^one ^single ^card, I'm going to be ^very upset with you. 
rob-h: Understood!
rob2: So, Edgar, you know my terms for the battle. What are yours? 
9: If you lose ... you have to ^tear ^up ^that ^deck ^of ^cards!!! 
9: Mwa ha ha ha ha!
boy2-a: No!
ing2: I didn't know paladins could be so spiteful.
9: Well ... now you know! Ha ha ha ha!
boy2-s: My cards ... my precious cards.
rob2-w: On second thought, let's not have this match. 
boy2-a: Your offer has been accepted, you can't change your mind you fool!

rob2-h: Ha ha! You lose, now ^tear ^up ^your ^deck!
boy2-w: No! The crusade.
rob2-s: Oh, right ...
rob2: You have to join the crusade.
9: Darn. Well, a deal's a deal. I look forward to dying beside you. 
rob2: Likewise.
boy2: We're not going to die, we're going to win.
9: This your first crusade  then?

boy-a: No you won't!
boy: You're trying to trick me again.

ing3-a: Isn't that right, Boyle?
boy3: Errr, yes.

Grunhilda2: Oh, isn't that nice!
Grunhilda2: Sit, sit.

ing3-h: Ha ha! This is great!
mys3-h: Hey Grunhilda, what is the ^most embarrassing thing Ingrid has ever done? 
Grunhilda2: One day when we were children -
ing3-a: !!!
mys3-s: Sorry ...
ing3: Play time is over. Come on Boyle.
boy3-a: I can't believe you tricked me like that!
ing3: Oh calm down, did you want to save the princess or not? 
ing3: Besides, that tea cozy cost me a lot of gold.
ing3: In case you missed it, the prince is frolicking around in the swamp as a frog. 

Event 2: EV002
Grunhilda: Well if it isn't my ^beautiful sister, Ingrid!
ing2: Grunhilda! Look at you, as unsightly as the day you were born! It's been too long. 
Grunhilda: Unsightly as I may be, ^I'm going to marry a prince. 
Grunhilda: You don't seem very surprised.
ing2: A cursed princess and a missing prince. I don't think I'll be running to the mystic to answer that one. 
Grunhilda: Regardless, I'll be a lot better off than you! Where is ^your husband? 
ing2: I'm going to marry Boyle the Horrible.
Grunhilda: Hmmm ... not much of a catch.
ing2: Actually, he was ^very difficult to catch.
ing2: At least, when I was trying to apply the curse.
Grunhilda: You know that unconditional love can still break that curse, right? 
ing2-s: Yeah ...
ing2-h: But who could ever ^love Boyle?
Grunhilda: Ha ha ha ha ha!
ing2-x: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
ing2: It feels nice to be able to have a good cackle again. 
ing2: But this wasn't the reason for my visit. That princess is cursed and it has your stench all over it. 
ing2: I don't know what you've got cooking up, nor do I care, but I need to cure the princess. 
Grunhilda: Those two were getting ^dangerously close. I had to put it on hold while I planned out my  next move. 
Grunhilda: I'm sorry, but I can't let you interfere.
ing2: Come on Grunhilda, give it up you hideous beast. You know this won't end well for you. 
Grunhilda: Forget it! I worked too long and hard on this for it to be taken away! 
ing2: ...
ing2-s: I feel the same way about Boyle ...
ing2: I guess you're not going to give it up. Fine. Have it your way you miserable wretch. 
ing2: Goodbye.
Grunhilda: Nice seeing you again!
ing2-h: Likewise!
ing2: I'm taking my glass slippers back!
Grunhilda: Why don't you just use your broomstick?
ing2-a: I left it at home!
Grunhilda: You still can't fly it, can you?

Event 1: S.Prince
ing: A peculiar frog indeed.
boy: A frog with a crown, huh?
ing: This must be our guy.
this: Hey! What is the meaning of this?
ing: We've rescued you. You're going back to the princess and waking her up. 
this: ^No! I will never go back!
ing-c: What are you talking about?
this: I was born in the wrong body! I was supposed to be a frog!  I know that now, and I'm never going  back. 
ing: You've got to be kidding me.
this: Where is that witch? Maybe she will curse me again! 
mys-s: That poor man. All  these years, he was a frog trapped in a man's body. 
mys-s: He was living a lie, and he had to do it alone.
boy: What are we supposed to do now? Our only hope just hopped away. 
ing: Well, not entirely. I was hoping we could do it the easy way, but truth be told we don't really need him.  
ing: ^Any paladin could do the job.
boy-w: ^Any paladin will do? Why didn't you tell us that before? 
ing-a: Pardon me for for thinking the easiest paladin to convince would be her ^boyfriend! 
ing: Besides, I ^knew you stole my tea cozy, and this gave me the means to prove it. 
boy: We'll tell the king. I'm sure he has plenty of paladins at his disposal.  
boy: But I'm not addressing ^any of them directly.
ing: Oh, right. You're terrified of them. Poor Boyle.
boy: That was a ruse. Your potion had no effect on me.

mys2: I've found you!
boy2-w: You again?
boy2-c: How did you get out of that cage?
mys2: I've decided to forgive you. And I'd still like to come with you. 
ing2-c: A mist wraith? How are you here? This should not be possible. 
mys2: This locket lets me go where I wish outside of the mist. I wish to be ^here. 
ing2: Why do you wish to be here, wraith?
mys2: It's him.
mys2: He confuses me. I thought I understood humans, but I was wrong.  
mys2: He is going on a great quest for a four-legs ... a creature not of his kind. 
mys2: I do not understand this, yet I want to. To understand, I must observe him. 
ing2-x: Ha!
ing2: He's a retired villain who failed at taking over the world once or twice, nothing more. 
ing2-a: And he's my future husband, not yours!
mys2: Yet, he is going to great length to save a fourlegs. 
boy2: Enough of this. Let me guess, you're going to follow me whether I want you to or not. 
boy2: If I say no  to you, you will plot until I say yes?
mys2-h: Yes.
ing2-h: Ha ha!
boy2: Ingrid, can't you turn her into something? Force her to go back? 
ing2: That would bring you joy. I enjoy watching you suffer. I vote for her to come with us. 
mys2: I vote for me to come with us.
boy2: Fine, you can come.
boy2-a: But don't get in my way and don't expect me to help you if you fall into a pit of venemous drake  snakes! 
mys2-c: Does this mean I should not help you if you fall into a pit of these venomous drake snakes? 
ing2-h: Ha ha!
boy2-a: Enough of this, let's go.

boy3: Have we found the portal to Aveyond?
ing3: It's giving me the creeps, so it's very likely.
boy3: Such wicked power ... never have I felt its equal. 
mys3-c: What are you talking about? This is the most beautiful feeling I've ever felt. 
ing3: Remember, Boyle, only those with good intent can enter Aveyond. 
ing3: If we try to enter for unholy reasons, we will wish we hadn't. 
ing3: How can we be sure our quest is noble?
boy3: There's only one way.
ing3-w: What is wrong with him?
ing3-c: How can he be so sure ...
mys3: Perhaps there is more good to him than we thought. 
ing3: If I end up a slave to some crazy angel I'm going to be very mad.

mys4-w: Boyle, we need to get you to a doctor!
boy4-a: Stop acting so strange.
boy4: Come on, we've got to look for the oars.
boy4-h: We'll have to keep looking, but I think they're close. 
boy4: For some reason my legs are tired. I feel like I've just run a marathon. 
ing4: Proportionately, you might have.
ing4: Hang on a second, Boyle.
boy4-a: I thought I told you not to do that!
ing4: You're fixed, but you still have a short temper.
mys: I'm glad you did that, I was short of ideas myself. 

Event 87: EV087
boy6: Alright, Fang. Find the witchetty grub!
boy6-h: Quickly!

Event 66: EV066
boy-w: Is that thing real?
ing: It looks real. But it's not moving.
boy: Myst, can't you tell?
mys: If it's real, it's doing a very good job of hiding it.
boy: What's even over there?
boy: Hardly seems worth it.
boy: There's our figurehead.
boy: Ingrid, do you think you can turn that dragon into a frog? 
mys: I'll go and get it.
ing: Fine.
mys5-a: Hey you, big dragon!
mys5: We need your statue!
boy5: That girl is going to get herself eaten.
ing5: Would that be so bad?
boy5: You're the one who invited her along.
ing5: Yes, but she's rather annoying, don't you think?
boy5: I had to trap her into a cage to get rid of her the first time. 
mys5: Here you go.
mys5: He said we could have it.
boy5: It spoke to you?
mys5: He doesn't want to hurt us. He's very tired.

row-s: It doesn't matter. Let's just get what we want so we can leave. 
hib: The Rickety Biscuit ... the name sounds familiar to me. 
row: It's an old war ship that belonged to our ancestors.  
row: It was quite a sight to behold back in the day.
hib-x: I imagine they had some pretty interesting dreams back then ... 
ing-a: Again?
hib-w: Ouch! I was just -
row: The people here reject the stories of our ancestors. 
row: We have a saying, there is no future in the ways of the past. 
row: I think it's all nonsense. Looking through the vault, I've learned a lot from their writings. 
row: In fact, I'm sure we could find something in there about the Rickety Biscuit. 
boy: Like what?
row-c: Like .. how to captain a ship.
boy: You're going to learn to captain a ship, from a book? 
row: I've learned everything else I know from those books. If it's in the vault, I can learn it. 
boy: Then we have no choice but to visit this vault.

boy: Right before you disappeared.
boy: Well, there will be no escape for you this time.
boy: And ^don't expect me to go easy on you!
Elizabeth: I'll do you the favor of cutting of your tongue before it gets you into more trouble.

hib-w: Ouch! Sorry ...
hib: I just don't want to slack on my training.
ing: Behave yourself and there may be time for that nonsense later. 
hib: It's quite late. We should find somewhere to rest and get an early start in the morning. 
rob: Hey, we could stay with Rowen's family.
rob-h: Then she could catch up with them and we have somewhere to stay for free! 
row-a: No!
rob-c: ...
ing: Robin, there are six of us. Do you think her familyhas space for us? 
rob: I always used to host groups of crusaders at my nan's house. It was a pleasure to give back to  those guys.

row4-c: So why did you do it?
hib4: There's too much I don't know.

hib2: I don't know, I think Miles may just be troubled right now ... 
ing2-a: If you start with your dream reading nonsense again we're taking you back to the  shrimps. 
hib2-w: I'll be quiet.
row2-s: I'm sure he's not up to anything, he's just being disagreeable. 
rob2-w: Ingrid! Watch out!
ing2: Oh, there you are.
boy2-c: What was the meaning of that?
ing2: Do you have the key?
boy2: Of course I have it.
