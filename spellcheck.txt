Event 37: S.Magic Shop
this: Hi.

Event 1: S.phy2
boy: Excuse me $end
rob: Yep, he's angry.
ing: We can calm him.
ing: I just need the right recipe.
rob: Yep, still angry.
ing: Here, drink this.
this: Will this sustain me, so that I may continue my work? 
ing: Yeah, sure.
ing: Are you calm now?
this: I ... am.
this: Forgive me, I must have been stewing in my anger for too long. 
this: So, you looking for a weapon?
rob: I like that one you're working on there.
this: Sorry, this one is special. I'm saving it for a certain demon. 
boy-w: You're supplying the demons with weapons?
this: Just one demon. Straight to the heart.
this: It's a unique blade. The more demon blood it spills, the more power it gains. 
boy: That's good to hear. So where is this demon?
this: In the Shadow Isles, enslaving my people.
boy: Do you know how to break the elemental barrier on Skull Mountain? 
this: I'd need to take a closer look at it, but I think so.
boy: In that case, I've got an idea.
boy: We'll help you fight this demon, and in return you will help us with the barrier. 
this: Okay, but my sword isn't ready yet. I'm about to head down to the forge to finish it off. 
this: It's very dangerous down there. And there are monsters. 
this: But if you're trying to climb Skull Mountain, I doubt you're worried about that. 
boy: Exactly.
mys-w: Speak for yourself, I'm ^terrified!
this: Come on, let's head for the furnace.
vn-rob-a: Hold it! $w.60
phy2-w: ...
boy-w: ...
ing-w: ...
rob-a: I challenge you to a game of two-card flip $w.60 ^for ^that ^sword! 
ing: Robin ... he needs that sword.
rob-s: Oh ...
phy2-h: Help me defeat this demon, and I'll make you your own sword. 
rob-h: Really!?
phy2: You seem like a powerful warrior. That old thing won't do for you. 
rob-w: Oops! I forgot to give Galahad's swordback!

4: A man of which countless tales have been told.

this: Fine, here comes the express!
this: I'm burned out.
this: You guys are cool, but you aren't Cole.

Event 1: rob4
Robin: Albert, help me settle an argument. What sound does a horse make? 
Horse: Neighhh!!!
Robin: I knew it!
Ingrid: Yep, he's our guy.

Event 23: brightsword2
boy: You're a foolish woman. I don't know why you tried to save me. 
boy: She's not well. She won't last much longer like this. 
boy: Come on, let's get her inside the base.
boy: Ingrid, do you have anything for her?
ing-c: It depends ...
ing-x: What do you want me to turn her into?
boy-a: Forget it.
boy: We'll have to see if we can get something back in town. 
boy: We should make it a priority. She'll die if we wait too long. 
boy: She won't last much longer.
boy: Looks like she's still breathing.
ing: Did it work?
boy-w: She's awake!
boy: Can you hear me?
boy: How are you feeling?
this: Betrayed ... $w.40 by my own father. $w.30
this: How ...
this: How could he do this?
boy: Looks like you're feeling better. Nice meeting you. 
this: Farewell.
boy: I'm leaving.
this: Very well.
boy: ^Fine!
boy: Let's hear it. What do you want me to do?
this: Excuse me?
boy: You want me to repay you for saving me.
this: I was just doing my duty.
this: I request nothing in return.
boy: No need for the guilt tactics. Just tell me what you want in return. 
this: But if you feel like you owe me something ...
boy-a: Of course I don't!
ing: ^Boyle? $w.20 Are you growing a conscience?
boy-a: No! I just know she's going to try to get something from me. 
boy-a: So she may as well ask now.
this: Help me bring my father to justice. That will be more than enough. 
boy: I can do that.
this: Take this.
this: That is the key to the guard tower just over  there. 
this: If Dad was conspiring with the demons, there must be some sort of clue in his room. 
this: Bring the evidence to me so we can track him down. 
boy: No problem.
this: It's my responsibility to bring my father to justice.
boy: We found an odd key in your father's possessions. 
this: Hmmm, it certainly looks demonic.
this: But it also looks like the keys we use here in the Royal Woods. 
this: He could be using an abandoned house to summon the demons here in the Royal Woods. 
this: If we find this house, maybe we can use it to summon my father. 
boy: But we have no idea where the house is.
this: Yes, that's true ...
this: There's a lot of slime on this key.
this: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
rob: I think we ^might be!
this: Great, I'll meet you there!
mys-c: So?
rob-c: What?
mys: What was she thinking?
rob: She said there was a lot of slime on the key.
rob-h: So naturally, the house will be in a very slimey place! 
mys-w: We know that, but she knew which slimey place it was in! 
rob-c: Why didn't she tell us then?
ing-a: Because you acted like you knew!
boy: I guess we'll have to find it ourselves.

Event 4: S.Ellie Brightsword
this: Begone evil beings!
boy: Fine, fine. We were just leaving.
boy3: Alright, try not to take too long. I don't have all day. 
ing3: What are you talking about? You're not coming?
boy3: That place is crawling with paladins.
boy3: It wouldn't be smart for me to go in there.
boy3: What if one of them gets me in a bad mood?
mys3-s: Boyle ...
mys3-h: You're not $w.45 ^scared $w.45 are you?
boy3-a: Of course not!
ing3-x: Ah ha ha ha ha!
this: Begone evil beings!
ing3: Relax, we're just here to join the crusade.
this: Evil beings in my crusade? I won't allow it!
ing3-a: We're good now! $w.45 And only two of us were even evil to begin with. 
boy3: Speak for yourself.
ing3-a: Shut up, Boyle!
ing3-h: Look, we've got a paladin.
rob3-w: Ouch!
rob3-s: Oh ...
rob3-h: Pleasure to meet you! I'm Robin!
this: I know who you are, fool. You're the stable boy.
this: Why aren't you tending to the horses?
rob3-s: Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I'll get to that right away.
mys3: ^Hold ^it!
mys3: Robin, come back.
mys3-a: Robin is a ^paladin now. He no longer tends to the stables. 
this: Hmmm ...
this: You know, he ^does seem different now.
this: Very well, Robin. Nice to have you on board. Are these your friends? 
rob3: The ladies are. I only have a minion-master relationship with Boyle. 
this: Fine, the ladies may join. The male can be gone.
boy3: Fine by me!
rob3: Please let him come with us!
rob3-s: He took me from a lowly stable boy to a paladin. I owe him everything. 
this: Only paladins and friends of paladins may join the crusade. 
this: So is he your friend or your master?
boy3-s: Fine, Robin is my friend.
rob3-h: I knew I'd earn your respect eventually, Boyle! 
boy3: Let's not dwell on it.
this: Congratulations, you're all now part of the crusade. 
rob3: Now let's go fight some demons!
this: Not so fast. I can't sign just anybody up for war. 
this: It's my duty to make sure the men and women I send are both willing and able. 
this: So ... $w.60 are you ^willing?
rob3: ... yes.
this: Good. You're willing, we're half way there. But are you $w.30 ^able? 
rob3: Yes.
this: That part's not quite so easy. 
this: You'll have to pass the tests first. Report to Dale.
this: Keep in mind, the tests were designed for paladins. 
boy3: Oh good, so they'll be easy.
this: ^Silence! $w.45 It would be a shame to have to cut off such a quick tongue. 
this: Some might describe Dale's attitude as salty, so just be forewarned. 
this: Did you fail the tests yet?
boy3: No!
this: Quiet, you!
rob: We've finished all of the tests!
this: Very good, Robin. I'm impressed with your progress. 
this: In ^and out of the stables.
rob: So when do we leave for the crusades?
this: Not for a while. We're still a bit short on numbers. 
boy3: We don't have time to sit around waiting. Let's just leave now. 
this: You sound like Dale. We can't show up with a half-full ship, the demons will see it as a sign of  weakness. 
rob: I don't understand, everybody should be chomping at the bit to go on a crusade like this! 
this: The king keeps a list of the registered fighers in the kingdom. 
this: Many still haven't shown up.
this: Get his list and convince three more men to join and we can set off on our crusade. 
rob: We'll be back before you know it!
boy3: You really think you can convince three men to join a pointless crusade in such a short time? 
rob: I can be very presuasive.
this: Convince three more men to join and we can leave. 
rob: Good news, we've recruited all of the men!
this: I'm impressed.
this: You've come a long way since your humble beginnings as a stable boy. 
rob-h: Thank you! You don't know how much that means to me! 
boy3: He was better as a stable boy if you ask me.
this: Are you coming, or waiting over there?
boy3-a: Of course I'm coming!
boy3: ^Somebody has to save the world, and I know you paladins aren't going to be the ones to do it. 
this: Well, you'd better come inside if you want to come with us. 
boy3-w: I'll wait until you're on the boats, thanks.
this: Fine, have it your way.

Event 37: T.House
ing: It's locked.

Event 29: S.Dale
this: So, the stable boy is joining the crusade now?
this: I knew we were short on numbers, but I didn't think the situation was this dire. 
rob-s: I'm sorry.
mys-a: Robin has courage! Why does it matter to you if he fights? 
this: I'm the one who will have to drag his body from the battlefield. 
this: Luckily we still have the tests to keep your kind out. 
rob-a: I'll pass any test you throw at me!
this: Your first test is a sparring session with me.
this: Arm yourself!
this: So you beat an old man. It means nothing.
this: Find and defeat the three trainers in the camp, and we'll consider you worthy enough to die on the  battlefield. 
this: And get yourself some decent armor from the merchant. 
rob-a: Understood!
rob-a: I'll win your respect if it costs me an arm!
this: You show no promise.
rob-a: We defeated all three trainers and earned their badges! 
this: I have no idea how.
this: Fine, you may join. I don't wish to hear more of this. 
ing: We should tell Ellie. She'll probably be more impressed. 
this: We don't need to speak again.

Event 5: EV005
mys: So how are we going to convince one of the paladins to join us? 
boy: A good old kidnapping. One of the classics.
ing-h: Ooh, I ^love a good kidnapping.
mys: No! That's what those demons did to my brother!
boy: And it worked out great for them.
boy: That's the thing about kidnappings. They never fail. 
mys: That makes us no different to those demons.
boy: Relax, we only need to get a paladin away from the pack to talk to him. 
boy: We won't force him to do anything against his will. 
mys: ... fine.
ing: Who are we going to kidnap?
boy: Find the weakest looking one so we're not met with too much resistance. 
boy: No need to be a hero.

Event 56: S.Emerick2
this: I never liked the water anyway!

boy: Not yet ... he could be powerful.
rob4: Albert, help me settle an argument. What sound does a horse make? 
Albert: Neighhh!!!
rob4-h: I knew it!
ing: Yep, he's our guy.
boy: Listen closely ... here's what we're going to do.
rob4: All done! All the animals have been locked away. 
rob4-h: Time to relax!
rob4-c: How did you get out?
rob4-h: Come on, let's get you inside.
rob4-w: ^Arrghhh!!!

boy: No need to go back in there.

Event 52: S.Storm2
this: Burn every last one, boys.
z-Goubert2: Huzzah!

Event 55: S.Goubert2
this: ...
z-Goubert2: Huzzah!

Event 32: S.Storm
this: You shouldn't speak to me, didn't you hear the storm warning? 
this: Batten down the hatches because there's a storm coming. 
this: Nobody has ever $w.30 weathered the storm.
this: I promised myself $w.30 I wasn't going to $w.30 ^storm ^off! 
this: Now I'm just a light shower.

Event 53: S.Marsh2
this: The ships are sinking one by one.
z-Goubert2: Huzzah!

Event 21: EV021
ing2: Wake up, Boyle.
ing2: WAKE.
ing2: UP!
boy2-w: !!!
ing2: Finally, he heard me.
boy2-a: Argh! Ingrid! Why would you wake me up!
boy2-s: I was having the most ^wonderful dream!
mys2: Poor Boyle, were you having a nightmare again? 
boy2: No ... for once I wasn't.
boy2-c: Wait, how did we get back here?
rob2-h: We fought valiantly, but ultimately we were defeated. 
ing2-s: Yes, it wasn't our best effort.
mys2: The paladins were not as fearless as expected. 
boy2: Yes, I remember now. They all abandoned us.
mys2: Except for one.
boy2: But how did we get back here? We were surrounded by demons. 
mys2: I've no idea. Something must have brought us back to the boat. 
rob2: So shall we head back for another round?
ing2: I don't think we're going back anytime soonn.
52: That's the way, boys. Burn every last one.
56: The demons will never get us now!
55: Here here!
rob2-w: The boats!
boy2: Never mind the boats, we have a new quest.
boy2: A man came to me in my dreams. He can fix my crippling nightmares if we find him. 
boy2: He left me with a clue ...
ing2: Are you still dizzy, Boyle?
boy2: He told me there's a secret passage somewhere in the Royal Castle. 
rob2: Sounds like fun! I've always dreamed about what might be under that castle! 
ing2: Come on, you guys don't really believe this, do you? 
mys2: How do we find the entrance?
boy2: If I'm to save the world, I'll need all of my wits about me. 
boy2: I'll search that town high and low if it means I don't have to dream about demons anymore. 
mys2: Boyle. Aren't you forgetting something?
boy2-c: What?
mys2: She risked her life to protect you.
boy2: ...

rob2-x: $w.30 $s.1 No ... none whatsoever. $s.3
boy2-c: What's with that stupid grin on your face?
rob2: Sorry, it just feels good to help out.

Event 4: EV004

ing-a: There isn't a curse strong enough to make me marry him! 
ing-h: Trust me, I'd know!
ing-x: Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
boy: Fine, if you get to wait outside, so do I.
ing: What do you want to wait outside for?

rob-a: We won't let you down!

Event 3: EV003
Guard: Halt! Who goes there?
boy: We need to speak to the king.
Guard: He's not in a good mood at the moment. His daughter has been taken ill. 
Guard: But ...
Guard: If you really must speak to him, I'd recommened bringing him a gift. 
Guard: That always seems to lift his spirits.
boy: What does he like?
Guard: I haven't figured it out myself yet.
Guard: Maybe try asking the other guards around town. 
Guard: If you happen to find out what he likes, would you let me me know? 
Guard: I need to request permission to leave my post.
Guard: I have an appointment with the wedding planner next week. 
Guard: Halt! Who goes there?
Guard: Did you find a gift for the king?
boy: No.
Guard: Then I don't recommend going in there.
Guard: Halt! Who goes there?

Melvor: Can it be true!? Has a hero come to save us? 
boy: Well, I'm not really a hero ...
Melvor: But you are strong, right?
boy: I mean ... yeah.
boy: Actually, I came pretty close to ruling the world once upon a time. 
boy-h: How's that for tough?
Melvor: I think it will do! I look forward to you saving  us. 
Melvor: There's a yellow goblin running around with the key to the cell somewhere. 
boy: I'll find him. Nobody escapes Boyle.
boy: Don't worry guys, I'm breaking you out of here.
Melvor: Our hero! He has returned to save us!
boy: Okay, you're free. But there's one thing I don't understand. 
boy-c: Why did the goblins lock you in here?
Melvor: Oh, they didn't. We locked ourselves in here on account of the goblin king.

this: Indeed you have! This ferry is headed straight for Whisper Woods. 
boy: I'm just a normal, unassuming man who requires passage on this ferry. 
boy: Can you accomodate me?
this: ...
this: You sound a typical passenger, so I don't really see any problem with it. 
this: But no, I'm afraid I can't.
boy-c: You're refusing me access to the ferry? On what grounds? 
this: I'm not the ferryman, partner. I'd be ill-equipped to handle a vessel such as this. 
boy-a: Why didn't you say that in the first place?
this: I thought I would hear you out.
this: Ray and his boys went in to the Briar Woods yesterday. 
this: Something to do with reclaiming their possessions from the goblins. 
this: ... but they never returned.
boy:  Sounds like they got into trouble. I'll go look for  him. 
this: You some kind of hero or something?
boy-w: Hey, calm down. I'm just a normal, unassuming guy, remember? 
this: Well ... the Briar Woods are just south of Windshire. But it's very dangerous there.

Event 5: EV005
ing2: Hi, I'd like to board the ferry to Whisper Woods.
Ray: How many passengers?

boy2: No! You're ^my minion! You serve ^me!
mys2: Boyle, you're having night terrors.
ing2: Careful, if you stir him too fast, he'll be frightened when he wakes up. 
mys2-s: Oh, sorry.
ing2: No need to apologize. Here, let me try.
boy2: ^Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!
ing2-e: Ha ha ha ha ha! You should see the look on your face! 
boy2-a: ^What is the matter with you?
boy2-s: You know I don't sleep well ...
ing2-s: I know ...
ing2-e: And it's ^hilarious!
mys2: So, is this the Shadow Lands?
boy2: Afraid not. It looks like we've washed up someplace in the Royal Woods. 
boy2: We're closer, but we'll need another boat.
mys2-h: On the bright side, this place seems a lot friendlier than the places we've been to. 
boy2: Appearances can be deceiving. 
boy2: These woods are actually teeming with foul creatures of the most unsavory variety.  
boy2: Creatures that will give your ^nightmares nightmares. 
mys2-w: You mean ...
boy2: Paladins! The most vile creation in the history of time.  
boy2: Whichever foul demon spawned them must have been in a really sick mood that day. 
mys2: These paladins, they sound terrible.
boy2: They ^are terrible. It was paladins who threw us off that boat. 
ing2: It's true, they are wicked creatures, but they ^can be dealt with if you know how. 
ing2: They're actually a lot like dogs. They act purely out of desire for food and praise. 
boy2-a: Don't you dare compare Fang to a paladin!
ing2: Unfortunately for us, Boyle is well known to them. 
ing2: We're lucky his infamy has degraded so significantly. 
ing2: If his reputation meant anything anymore, they would have done more than just throw us overboard. 
ing2: I guess they don't consider him a threat whatsoever. 
ing2: Aren't ^we lucky!
boy2-a: They were afraid of incurring my wrath! Spineless as always! 
boy2: With any luck, we won't run into them again. We just need to get a new ship and leave. 

Event 13: S.Willem
this: Argh! I had my map ready so I could search for the legendary Crab Island. 
this: I got careless and the crabs chopped it up into four pieces and scuttled off with them. 
this: If you can find them, I may share the secret of crab island with you. 
this: I need to watch over my raft. I don't want that cut up into quarters. 
this: You found my four map quarters yet?
this: Ahhh, you've found them. Good work.
this: Here, I'll put it back together.
this: Alright, with this I should be able to deduce the location of Crab Island. 
this: What is Crab Island, you ask?
this: Well, legend says a ^giant crab makes his home there. 
this: My goal is to meet this crab.
this: However!
this: As you may have noticed, my raft was sadly cut up into quarters by that lone crab while you were  gone. 
this: Would you care to fight him?
boy: This crab doesn't want to fight.
this: But ... he cut up my boat.
boy-h: He has giant claws, he probably wanted to use them. 
this: So what are you going to do with him?
boy-h: I can tell a minion when I see one.
this: As long as he stays away from my raft!
this: So anyway ... I guess we won't be going to Crab Island anytime soon. 
this: Do any of you know how to repair a raft?
boy: Afraid not.
this: Well, if you're ever travelling with somebody handy, bring them by here. 
this: I simply must gain passage to Crab Island!
this: Swing by when you find someone handy.
mys-h: We've found somebody handy!
this: Really? Who?
mys: It's Rowen!

ing-w: You can't be serious!
this: Where is that witch? Maybe she will curse me again! 
mys-s: That poor man. He just wanted to be a frog.
boy: What are we supposed to do now? Our only hope just hopped away. 
ing: Well, not entirely. I was hoping we could do it the easy way, but truth be told, we don't really need him.  
ing: ^Any paladin could do the job.
boy-w: ^Any paladin will do? Why didn't you tell us that before? 
ing-a: Pardon me for for thinking the easiest paladin to convince would be her ^boyfriend! 
ing: Besides, I ^knew you stole my tea cozy, and this gave me the means to prove it. 
boy: We'll tell the king. I'm sure he has plenty of paladins at his disposal.  
boy: But I'm not addressing ^any of them directly.

this: Aveyond is in peril. All of the priestesses must return immediately! 
ing: Why aren't they here already?
this: Three of them were sent out to spread joy and peace, and find potential priestesses. 
this: In times like these, we need to consolidate all of our priestesses in one place. 
this: If you could return them to me, I could bring joy and peace to your own lives. 
ing: Yuck. No thanks.
boy: She ^might be talking about gold. $w.30 Are you talking about gold? 
this: I'm talking about something much greater than gold. 
boy-h: Diamonds?
this: When you get this, you will have no need for gold or diamonds. 
boy: Okay, now I'm interested.
this: The priestesses are spread far and wide. Finding them will not be easy. 
this: They're also trying to keep a low profile, so they will be blending in with the environment. 
this: They're not very good at it though, and will reveal themselves if you talk to them for long enough.

sys: Boyle gained a stat.
boy-w: What did you do to me?
this: We allowed peace into your heart.
boy: If I start bursting into song or something, you're going to hear from me again. 
this: Hee hee!
this: Please live a good life.

Event 1: U.Aveyonder
ing: What's this supposed to be?
boy-h: It's kind of like a treasure chest.
mys-w: Are you sure that's a good idea, Boyle? 
boy: How could it ^possibly be a bad idea?
ing: Everybody knows how petty these holy beings can be. 
boy-x: What are they going to do, cast a prayer on me? 
ing-x: Ha ha ha ha ha!
mys-h: Hee hee!
Nymph: Thief of Aveyond - be ^blessed!
boy-a: ^Hey! $w.60 What did you just do to me?
Nymph: As punishment for stealing from the goddess's sacred coffers, I ^blessed you to have  bad luck for seven years. 
ing: That sounds more like a curse to me.
Nymph: We don't use that word around here. We are not villains. We bestow blessings, not curses. 
boy: I can't have bad luck for seven years! How am I going to play two-card flip with no luck? 
ing: You never won before you were cursed, so I don't imagine it will make much of a difference. 
boy-a: Nymph, I demand you uncurse me right now! Or face my wrath! 
Nymph: Don't take that tone with me, I'm protected by the goddess so long as I'm in Aveyond. Your threats  are useless here. 
boy-h: Oh really? Is that what you think?
boy: But what if I was to ...
boy-s: Beg?
Nymph: I can't ^unbless you. I'm not a warlock.
Nymph: The only way to remove the blessing  would be to pay back the gold you stole ... 
boy: Well that doesn't seem too - $end
Nymph: To ^ten ^different^ ^donation ^boxes.
boy-w: What!? But there aren't even that many on this ^continent! 
Nymph: Then I suppose you'll have to seek other continents.  
Nymph: Or we could two-card flip for it. But given your predicament, I don't think that's a good idea. Ha  ha. 
boy: You're quite malicious for a holy creature.
Nymph: Return to me once you've made donations to the ten statues, and I'll try to unbless you. 
sys: The goddess statue is thankful for the donation.

Event 49: S.Ceanna
this: I came home.

Event 8: EV008

x-Hercules: Welcome back to the world of the living, my friend. 
x-31: It seems that all the tales I read about your bravery were not wrong.  
x-Hercules: The oracle did not see the good in our plan so I turned her to stone. 
x-Hercules: Now that you are free from your prison, should I turn her back? 
x-31: ...
x-31: Let's leave her like that for a little longer.
x-31: She may object to the sacrificing of the child.
boy2: How can you think that thing isn't evil?
x-Hercules: He cares only for the good of mankind, like myself! 
x-Hercules: It's something only non-villains can sense. 
x-31: I must go. Even projecting myself into this place tears at my soul. 
x-Hercules: It must be these villains! They're bringing corruption to Aveyond. 
x-Hercules: Now that you mention it, I feel a ^little over-exerted myself. 
x-31: Yes, that explains it. Hurry back to Skull Mountain. 
Hercules: See, my friend is good.
mys2: Hey, that's ^my brother!
Hercules: You are related to the ancient evil? I knew you were a villain too. 
mys2-a: Come on, let's get him!
Hercules: Uh oh! Time to go.
mys2-a: My brother! We must go to him.
boy2: Stay away from the mirror, Myst.
mys2: Why? He needs me!
boy2: Ingrid and I can't use magic mirrors. We're ^villains. It's part of the protection on them. 
mys2: I can go alone ...
boy2: And give Hercules the chance to present two mist wraiths to his demon? We need to find another  way. 
mys2: What are we to do then?
boy2: I recognize the place. It’s a common location for villains to open demon portals.  
boy2: It’s called Skull Mountain, and it’s found in the Shadow Isles. 
mys2: Let's go then.
boy2: Not so fast.
boy2: I've discovered what happened to your brother. 
boy2: I'm not doing anything else until your mother clears the mist and gives me back my dog. 
mys2-s: Fine.
mys2: We'll have to take the ferry back to Windshire then. 
boy2-s: ...
ing2-s: ... ummm.
mys2-c: What?

ing-c: Are you sure that's a good idea? 
boy: How could it be a bad idea?
ing: We're in a holy place ... we're pushing our luck just being here. 
ing: Everybody knows how vengeful and traditional holy beings can be. 
boy-e: What are they going to do, cast a prayer on me? Ha ha ha! 
ing-e: HA HA HA HA HA HA HA.
Nymph: Thief of Aveyond - be blessed!

boy-h: Oh really? Is that what you think?
boy: But what if I was to ...
boy-s: Beg?
Nymph: I can't ^unbless you. I can only apply the blessings. 
Nymph: The only way to remove the blessing  would be to pay back the gold you stole ... 
boy: Well that doesn't seem too-
Nymph: To ^ten ^different^ ^donation ^boxes.
boy-s: What!? But there aren't even that many on this continent. 
Nymph: Then I suppose you'll have to seek other continents.  
Nymph: Or we could two-card flip for it. But given your predicament, I don't think that's a good idea. Ha  ha.

boy-c: I know we're not wanted here but I wasn't  expecting ^this.

boy-a: You don't have to tell ^me that!
mys: She's been turned to into a statue, Boyle.
boy-w: What!?
boy: Well that explains her stony demeanor.
ing: Somebody must have cursed her.
boy: In Aveyond? Impossible! People of ill-intent cannot enter this sacred place. 
boy: Trust me, I tried many times myself.
Hercules: Boyle the Horrible?
Hercules: Step away from the villain, fair folk, I shall slay him for you! 
mys2: You are mistaken, we are with him. And he's a ^retired villain. 
ing2: What are you doing here, Hercules? What happened to the Oracle? 
Hercules: Oh, were you here to see her? I turned her to stone. 
ing2: Aren't you supposed to be on ^her side?
Hercules: We had a disagreement.
ing2: Well, turn her back. We need to talk to her.
Hercules: I'm sorry, I cannot do that. $w.15 At least not ^yet. 
Hercules: She wouldn't let me use her magic mirror.
mys2: What use does a fair knight have for a magic mirror? 
Hercules: It's a long story.
mys2: Oh, please tell me! I love long stories.
mys2: Even where I come from, we have heard of the stories of the brave Hercules. 
Hercules: You honor me. Okay, I shall tell you the story. 
Hercules: About a fortnight ago, I was thinking up a title for my new book when I heard a strange voice. 
Hercules: He told me that an ancient evil was about to be reborn. 
Hercules: And only by sacrificing him under the blood moon could we save the world. 
Hercules: Naturally, I offered to help.
Hercules: I captured the child and imprisoned him high on a mountain. 
Hercules: I came here to talk the Oracle into releasing my friend, so he may sacrifice the child. 
Hercules: She became irate, and I was forced to use the stone amulet my friend gave me. 
mys2-a: You ^stole ^my ^brother!?
boy2: Hercules, let me guess ... your friend is a demon. 
Hercules: Well, yes, but he's a good demon.
boy2: There are no good demons, you fool! And they always lie. 
Hercules: You lie, foul creature! Do not speak of my friend this way. His word is good.  
ing2: Hercules, we demand that you return the child that you stole. 
Hercules: I’m tired of listening to your lies.
Hercules: Speak to my friend for yourself, then you will see.

Event 3: EV003

row2: As far as I'm concerned, there's only way we're getting past it. 
boy2: Yes, of course ...
vn-ing-a: You better not be daydreaming about my dragon again! 
vn-boy-w: No, no!!! Of course not! I would never!
row2: I was actually thinking about the ancient Draaghar race. 
boy2-w: Yes, that's precisely what I was daydreaming - I mean thinking about. 
row2: They used to live nearby, in Ravwyn, before their town was enslaved by a demon. 
row2: If we can find one, they may know how to break this gate. 
row2: I have a theory that there are some living in the old stronghold in the Dragon Wasteland. 
mys2: But the Draaghars don't exist anymore.
rob2: Sorry, Rowen. It's a wasteland out there.
row2-h: The stronghold still exists, there are Draghar's living there right now. 
row2-x: I thought you guys knew.
boy2-w: ^Nobody knows that!
row2: The only problem is, how do we get there?
row2-h: I've got it!
row2: If the kobolds in the Dragon Wasteland have the power to summon dragons ... 
row2: It means they've found a way into the ancient caves. 
row2: We'll need to borrow their technology.

mys-a: Because ...
mys-s: If we enter the mist realm, I will die.
boy-a: No you won't!

----------------------------------------

Event 1: EV001
boy2-w: Here again?
boy2: Do you mind explaining exactly what this place is. 
hib2: This is the dream realm.
hib2: People have a tendency to believe their dreams are disconnected from reality. 
hib2: But in fact, they all occur in a persistent realm known as the dream world. 
boy2: What? Why have I never heard of this place before? 
hib2: The dream plains are a sacred place, with access granted to only the most enlightened  individuals.  
hib2-h: Incidentally, they're also a great place to find clients! 
hib2: People usually only encounter this particular part of the dream realm when they've been infected. 
hib2: Animals are more in touch with nature. You've probably seen a few of those around here. 
boy2: Does that mean all the animals I've been fighting in here ... are real animals? 
hib2: Yes.
hib2: But don't worry, you were just waking them up.
hib2: You can't actually hurt yourself in the dream realm. 
boy2: Great, so who do we fight?
hib2: I'm afraid it's not that simple.
hib2: All dreams stem from ideas and beliefs.
hib2: Sometimes these ideas can run away with themselves, allowing corruption to set in. 
hib2: We'll need to delve into your consciousness to find the source of the corruption. 
boy2: And then what?
hib2: We kill it.
boy2: I  knew it!
hib2: We'll need to see if we can find the place where your nightmare occurs. 
hib2: Once we're there, we'll have to see it through to completion without waking up. 

Event 5: EV005

boy: Apologies.

Event 56: S.Shopkeep
this: Take a look around if you like.

Event 55: U.Chris
this: Greetings. I am the boss of the night watch.
this: Banana Boy tells me very good things about you. 
rob: That's good, I was a little worried about meeting you. 
this: Your fears were warranted. I think very little of Banana Boy. 
this: But if you think you can defeat the werebear, I may as well utilize you. 
this: We've looked into the possibility of tracking him, and come up with a few ideas. 
this: It is true the werebear wanders the woods at night. 
this: But he still needs to eat, sleep and entertain himself. 
this: If you can find evidence of each of these things, I'll be able to triangulate his position. 
this: He's only active during the night, so you should only ^search during the night. 
mys: I liked Banana Boy better.
this: But he still needs to eat, sleep and entertain himself. 
this: If you can find evidence of each of these things, I'll be able to track him down. 
this: He's only active during the night, so you should only ^search during the night. 
mys: We've gathered evidence on the werebear.
mys: He's been eating ^acorns.
mys: He has a ^red blanket.
mys: And his favorite thing to do is ^play ^golf.
this: Very interesting. This should be enough to track his location. 
this: While I work on this, you work on gaining favor with the night watch. 
this: Once you've reached rank of squirrel, I'll be able to tell you more. 
this: While I work on this, you work on gaining favor with the night watch. 
this: Once you've reached rank of squirrel, I'll be able to tell you more. 
this: Good, you've reached the next rank.
this: Just in time too, because I've finished tracking the werebear's ^were - a - ^bouts. 
this: It seems he's holed up in a secret cave in the forest. 
this: There is no path through the cave, so I've had a special rodent team dig up another entrance. 
this: They'll bury it again each morning, so you have to go in the day. 
this: When you find the werebear, use this.
this: It will turn him back into a human.
this: I don't want you to hurt him, just send him home.
this: It seems the werebear holed up in a secret cave in the forest. 
this: There is no path through the cave, so I've had a special rodent team dig up another entrance. 
this: They'll bury it again each morning, so you have to go in the day. 
this: I see you've returned in one piece.
this: Did my salve work?
mys-a: No, it didn't do anything!
this: Oh well.
this: I'll work on a new salve. Check back with me later. 
this: I thought the salve would work. I'm very surprised. 

Event 3: S.Woman6
this: I haven't seen my son in a number of years, since he left to become a great paladin like his father. 
this: I hope he is doing well.

Event 50: S.Percy2
this: Come with me.
this: Welcome to the night watch.
this: We watch over the town during the night.
this: Our leader went into the Gingernut Forest on serious business and hasn't returned. 
this: We need somebody skilled to look for him.
rob: We'll do it!
this: Be careful. There are dangerous creatures out at night. 
this: Good luck.

Event 21: Library
This is actually the library

Event 53: EV053
49: Thank you for saving me. I'm happy to induct you into the night watch. 
rob: Wow, praised by the leader of the night watch!
49: I am not the leader of the nightwatch. I am just the leader of this ^this base. 
rob-w: There are other bases?
49: Yes, there are many great hiding places in this town we've made use of. 
49: But you won't see those until you've gained ranks in the nightwatch. 
mys: Do you know of any secret passages in the castle? 
49: Not off the top of my head, but I'll give you a hint.
49: Check out the library. They have plenty maps of the town. 
49: Sometimes they reveal more than they mean to.
rob-h: Thanks a lot!
49: I actually wanted to request further assistance from you. 
49: But these matters can only be trusted to official night watch members. 
49: If you want to know the reason I was in those woods, you will need to earn membership. 
rob: Just tell us how.
49: You can gain favor by fighting creatures at night and bringing us glow bugs. 
49: Some other night watch members may also have tasks for you from time to time. 
49: Speak to me again once you've gained enough rank with us. 
49: I hear you can track your progress by opening ^party ^screen. 
49: But to this day, I still haven't been able to figure out what a ^party ^screen is. 
49: Anyway, it's almost morning, you should head back to the inn to sleep. 
49: When you're ready to night watch again, just organize another wake-up call. 

Event 29: S.Shopkeep
this: Take a look around if you like.

Event 39: EV039
x-38: Wake-up call for Boyle!
rob2-w: Not so loud!
38: Are you Boyle?
rob2: ...
rob2-x: Yes.
38: My master is waiting for you outside.
rob2-h: I'll be right down!
mys2: Heading out, Robin?
rob2: I didn't know you were awake.
mys2: I sleep lightly.
mys2: I'll come with you.
rob2: Okay!
x-38: Wake-up call!
rob2-w: Not so loud!

Event 49: U.Banana Boy
this: Speak to me once you're official night watch members. 
49: Good, you're official members. Now we can have a frank conversation. 
49: The reason I went into that forest at night was because rumors of a werebear have been  circulating. 
49: If the rumors are true, then the town is in grave danger. 
49: I'm launching an investigation.
49: Try speaking to the people in the small forest town to see if anybody knows anything. 
49: Be careful though, I tried questioning them myself, but I was chased off with a broom. 
49: Obviously they are too scared to talk.
49: Try speaking to the people in the small forest town to see if anybody knows anything. 
49: Be careful though, I tried questioning them myself, but I was chased off with a broom. 
mys: One of the men in the town was kind enough to give us information about the werebear. 
mys: He said the werebear roams the entire island.
mys: And he might have left clues that could lead us to him. 
this: Well done. This is very useful information.
rob: Shall we go search for clues?
this: Not yet. We don't yet know what we are looking for. 
this: We may have to involve the higher-ups.
rob-w: I thought ^you were the leader of the night watch, Banana Boy. 
this: Unfortunately not. The chain of command extends well beyond me. 
this: If you want to continue to be involved in this matter, you'll need to gain more standing with us. 
this: I'll tell the guards in the Witchy Woods to let you in. That should help you to help us. 
this: Speak to me when you've reached the next rank. 
this: I'll tell the guards in the Witchy Woods to let you in. That should help you to help us. 
this: Speak to me when you've reached the next rank. 
this: Good, looks like you've increased your standing.
this: It's time to let you in on a little secret.
this: This here is the night watch headquarters, but it isn't ^the night watch headquarters. 
this: There is actually a second, more secret headquarters. 
this: There, you will find my boss.
this: He knows you're coming. We've had words about you. 
this: Enter the abandoned building on the east side of town. 
this: And make sure you don't tell ^anybody about it!
this: You may not report to me directly anymore, but I'm still your boss. 
this: Thank you for meeting me here.
this: I have a theory about the werebear, but I need your absolute trust to explain it to you. 
this: You will have to increase your standing with the night watch further if I'm to tell you. 
this: I have a theory about the werebear, but I need your absolute trust to explain it to you. 
this: You will have to increase your standing with the night watch further if I'm to tell you. 
this: Good, you're now a squirrel. I can finally reveal this secret to you. 
this: I don't believe that the werebear is a bear at all.
this: I think he's a were-something. And the ^something is going to be our clue to figuring the  whole thing out. 
this: I've prepared an anti-were that you can administer to him. 
this: He seems to have made his way to the top of the royal hills. 
this: It's the most dangerous place in these parts, so he probably thinks we won't go there. 
this: I'll let the guard know that you're coming.
this: Administer the salve. It's very important we capture him alive. 
this: The werebear made his way to the top of the royal hills. 
this: Administer the salve. It's very important we capture him alive.

rob2-w: But Banana Boy isn't here yet!
mys2: He'll be here soon, we just have to keep him busy. 
rob2-c: Keep him busy? How are we supposed to do ^that? 
mys2-w: I think he's already decided for us.
10: Sorry I'm late, guys.
10: Now, what do you say we use this anti-wear salve and see what happens? 
mys2-w: So the werebear was actually a were ^squirrel!? 
10: And not just ^any squirrel. That's the leader of the night watch! 
8: Finally I'm free.
8: World domination will be ours!
8: Banana Boy, you'll be my new right-hand racoon.
8: I owe a great deal to you humans.
8: Meet me at the secret base and I will reward you.
rob2: You mean Chris's base?
8: No, the other secret base.
8: The one in the castle courtyard.
8: Tell the jester about us, we've smartened him up.
8: He'll let you in.

Event 13: S.Tray

@b: No

Event 7: EV007
ing-s: Ummm ... hi.
Ray: What do you want!? I have nothing else! I swear! 
ing-c: Ummm ... Boyle has something to ask you.
boy-a: What!? Why me?
ing: You burned it.
boy-a: ...
boy-a: Fine.
boy-c: $s.1 So ... $s.3
boy: $s.3 We've decided to give you a chance to get back to Windshire. 
Ray: $s.1 I'm listening ... 
boy: $s.3 We require the ferry.
Ray: You're ^kidding, right?
Ray: In case you've forgotten, ^you ^destroyed ^it!
boy: Ingrid regrets what happened, but now the time has come to look for solutions. 
Ray: You all thought it was ^so funny, sinking my ferry and walking off! Leaving me stranded here! 
Ray: But now you've come ^crawling back! Like the pathetic worms that you are! 
ing: You sealed that ferry's fate when you threatened me in front of my future husband! 
boy: So what do you say? Can we put this whole thing behind us and fix the ferry? 
Ray: It's possible. 
Ray: But I'll need a few things, and I'm ^not getting them myself! 
boy: That's okay, we'll get them.
Ray: Bring me ten pieces of nice wood. That should be enough to put the boat back together. 
Ray: Oh, and a few fairies flew away with the oars, so you'll need to get those back too. 
boy: Fine.
Ray: And of course, I'll need a new figurehead for the ferry. 
boy-a: What? The ferry didn't have a figurehead before. 
Ray: I know ... it always upset me.
Ray: I'm sure there's something in those woods. Be creative. 

Event 4: S.Ray
this: ...
ing: What's wrong, run out of smug comments?
boy: Ha ha ha ha!
ing-x: Ha ha ha!
this: ...
this: What's wrong, run out of smarmy jokes?
this: Ha ha ha ha ha!
boy: We've got everything, let's fix this ferry.
this: ...
this: ^All $w.30 of it?
boy: Yes, we found a figurehead, if that's what you're asking. 
this: Wow! That thing is perfect!
boy-c: It seems a bit heavy, don't you think?
ing-w: It's almost as big as the ferry!
this: It'll be fine.
this: I'll just tuck it in by the tail.
this: Alright, let's do it!
this: It's beautiful!
ing3-c: Are you sure that thing is safe?
this: It'll be fine. She's a tough boat.
mys3-w: She's partially submerged!
this: It's fine!
this: Once we get back, we'll go our separate ways.
this: I'll give you a day head start before I report you.
boy3: So kind of you.
ing3-c: Hello. What's this?
this: Oh, that's nothing!!!
ing3: A message in a bottle.
boy3-c: Really!?
ing3: Let's see what it says ...
this: There's no time for that!
ing3: ^If ^somebody ^finds ^this, ^please ^send ^help.
ing3: ^I've ^been ^captured ^by ^a ^group ^of ^villains. 
ing3: ^They ^burned ^my ^ferry ^and ^left ^me ^on ^the ^shore ^of ^Whisper ^Woods. 
ing3: ^Send ^an ^army.
ing3: ^Regards. ^Ray.
ing3-w: ...
ing3-x: Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
ing3-x: He tried to send for help with a message in a bottle, and it got carried back to shore! 
boy3-h: Ha ha ha ha!
this: ...
this: So ... shall we leave for Windshire now?
ing3: Yeah, right!
mys3: Ingrid, we made a promise!
ing3: We can't risk having him betray us again.
ing3: Alright, Boyle, the ferry can only hold the weight of two, so you're up next. 
boy3-w: Wait.
ing3: What?
boy3: Myst is incredibly light, the ferry will be fine.
boy3: Here, watch how far I can throw her.
mys3-a: Don't you dare!
ing3: I'll take your word for it.
ing3: But if I feel any water on my feet, you're gonna croak. 

Event 3: EV003

boy2: Are you going to turn me back into a human now? 
ing2: A human? Never. But I can get you back to what you were before. 
boy2: Very funny. Just hurry up.
boy2: Thank you.
Ray: ^Hey!!!
Ray: Hey, how did you get out of prison!?
ing2: Oops, we probably should have walked around the corner first. 
Ray: I'm going back to Windshire to get the villagers ... ^one ^at ^a ^time! 
ing2-w: Oh no! $w.30 Boyle, what are we going to do? 
boy2-w: Why, there's nothing we ^can do, Ingrid!
boy2: Oh, wait, we can do this.
Ray: What have you done!?
ing2-x: Ah ha ha ha ha ha!
ing2: Oh, I'm sorry. I guess your friends could swim over. 
ing2-h: But your torches would go out, and then how would you burn us? 
boy2-h: Ha ha ha ha!
Ray: I need to get back to Windshire!
boy2: Better start swimming then!
boy2: Come on Ingrid, let's go to Aveyond.

Event 3: EV003
1: ^Ingrid! You came to visit me!?
1: I've missed you ^so ^much! What have you been doing? 
ing2: Hello, sister.
1: I don't know how this is possible, but your beauty has grown since even the last time I saw you. 
1: What wicked concoctions have you been imbibing? 
ing2-a: That's none of your business!
1: Sorry, Ingrid.
boy2: I suppose this one is your ^younger sister, then? 
rob2-s: I wish I had a younger brother.
rob2-a: I'd teach him so many things and look after him when nan goes to town! 
1: Look Ingrid, I made my house just like yours!
ing2-a: Yes, I noticed ...
ing2: Tell me, sister, did you put a curse on the carpenter at the end of the world? 
t-1: Hee hee.
ing2: I'll take that as a yes.
1: He's ^sooooooooooo talented!
1: He made all of my furniture EXACTLY like yours!
1: I wanted to see how good he was, so I shrunk down his family so he would have to make them tiny  furniture. 
z-1: And he did it!
t-1: Hee hee!
ing2-a: You did a bad thing, sister. A very bad thing.
ing2: Now you need to undo it.
1: Ummm ...
1: How?
ing2: You created the curse, you should know.
1: Jinx always helped me with my counter-curses ... 
ing2: You mean you can't get rid of it?
1: I'm sorry, Ingrid! Please forgive me.
1: Maybe if you helped me ...
1: We could do it together?
ing2: How would that work?
1: Well, when I was collecting a dragon bone for my curse, some guy came up to me and kept bugging me  for it. 
1: He was a weakling, so he couldn't get anything himself. 
1: He said he could create any spell I wanted, he just needed the dragon bone. 
1: He wouldn't stop bugging me, so I made a centipede chase him away and forgot about it. 
ing2-w: You think he was telling the truth?
1: I could tell he was smart. $w.30 Like you!
ing2: I suppose it could work.
ing2-x: And if he's lying, we can always have fun cursing him! 
1: You'll have to help me get another dragon bone. I'll meet you in the Dragon Wasteland. 
1: There's a big pile of old bones where we can find what we need. 
1: I'll meet you there.
boy: Well she's a lot more pleasant than you are, Ingrid. 
ing: And yet ^I'm the one you're marrying.

Event 1: S.Lorelai
this: Ingriiiiiiiiiid!
this: Have you come here to start our coven?
ing-c: Hmmm, if I join this coven, I can learn some new curses. 
ing: But once I'm in a coven, I won't be able to join a different one later. 
@a: Yes
@b: No
ing: Okay, may as well get this over with.
z-this: Yaaaaaaaaay!
this: This is going to ^so ^much ^fun!
this: But ...
this: I haven't set anything up yet ...
this: We don't even have a unique hat to represent us. 
ing-w: Oh no!
ing: We'll have to do that first.
this: I saw this pretty cool cursed skull in the Dragon Wasteland ... 
ing-x: That'll do perfectly.
ing: I will find this skull.
this: I'll be planning our next move!
ing: No thanks.
this: ^Ingriiiiiiiiiid!
this: It would be the ^best ^coven ^ever!!!
this: I saw this pretty cool cursed skull in the Dragon Wasteland ... 
ing: I will find this skull.
ing: I found the skull.
this: Good, pass me your hat for a second ...
sys: Ingrid hands her hat over to Lorelai.
this: Here you go!
ing-x: This is more like it!
this: Now that we're official, I can start teaching you some curses. 
this: But in order to do so, I need you to bring me something. 
ing: What is it?
this: There is a girl in Tor who owns an ugly teddy bear. 
this: I need you to bring me the teddy bear.
this: There is a girl in Tor who owns an ugly teddy bear. 
this: I need you to bring me the teddy bear.
ing: I've got the teddy bear.
ing: But how is this going to help me learn curses?
this: You'll see.
this: Hee hee!
this: Hee hee hee!
z-this: Ha ha ha ha ha!
this: Okay, I'm done.
this: You can take it back to her now.
this: We'll see if she calls me a smelly witch again!
ing-w: Sometimes I forget how childish you are.
this: Once you do this, I can teach you a curse!
this: You can take the bear back to her now.
this: We'll see if she calls me a smelly witch again!
ing: I gave the cursed bear back to her.
this: Yaaay!
this: Okay, I'll teach you a curse now.
sys: Ingrid learns curse of life.
this: Cursing something so innocent and unassuming gave me an idea. 
this: What would happen if I did the same thing to a health potion? 
this: Let's find out.
this: If you find anywhere that sells health potions, bring me five! 
this: If you find anywhere that sells health potions, bring me five! 
ing: Here are the health potions.
this: Let's see what happens!
this: Alright, so if I just do this ...
this: And ...
z-this: Ha ha ha ha ha!
this: It worked!
this: Here you go.
this: Hopefully these help you a lot when you're fighting baddies! 
this: So anyway, I've been thinking ...
this: If we want to be taken seriously as a coven, we'll need to recruit some new members. 
this: I've been thinking about it and I'm pretty sure we should be able to get three new members. 
this: I had an old classmate who went to Evanwall with me to search for a coven to join. 
this: We got into a fight and I abandoned her there.
this: But she's probably over it by now, so you should see if she'll join! 
this: One of the witches in Wyrmwood was really nice to me, so she might join. 
this: And finally ...
this: Hee hee!
this: Let's steal one from Jinx's coven!
ing: Is that a good idea?
this: She has tons of them! She likes helping me anyway! 
this: I had an old classmate who went to Evanwall with me to search for a coven to join. 
this: One of the witches in Wyrmwood was really nice to me, so she might join. 
this: And finally ...
this: Let's steal one from Jinx's coven!
ing: We've convinced three members to join.
this: So now that we have a complete coven, I think it's time to do something with it. 
this: And I've thought of ^just the thing.
this: Here.
this: Take this letter to the guardhouse in Windshire and leave it on the table. 
this: The head guard will read it and warn everybody in town to stay in their houses. 
this: Then, we will strike.
ing: Sound like a solid plan.
this: Take the letter to the guardhouse in Windshire and leave it on the table. 
this: The head guard will read it and warn everybody in town to stay in their houses. 
ing: The letter has been delivered.
this: Good.
this: All we have to do now, is wait until dark.
this: And then, it will be time ...
this: For the siege on windshire!
this: Our siege was a success.
this: We struck fear into the heart of Windshire, ^and we got some candy! 
this: We should celebrate with a new curse.
sys: Ingrid has learned curse of death.
this: That's my most powerful curse.
this: It should kill anything that isn't enormous, but it's very draining, so make sure you rest. 
this: I hope we can do some more stuff together in the future.

14: Wooooow! You must be really strong!
boy: Well ...
14: Was it hard? To beat the king I mean.
boy: No, no, of course not. Not for me.
16: Hold it! Hold it I say!
16: That's no hero, that's ^Boyle ^the ^Horrible!
Ray: You're right! It ^is Boyle the Horrible!
Melvor: I'd all but forgotten about him!
16: I told you nothing gets past these eyes!
boy: Hey, let's calm down for a second ... did you forget who just saved these boys from a goblin king? 
16: Get him boys!
boy-a: I just ^saved you! This is how you're repaying me? 
Haaf: Silence, villain!
Ray: What should we do with him?
16: Let's burn him at the stake!
Haaf: Great idea!
boy-w: What!?
Ray: Cool! I don't think I've ever seen it used!
Haaf: Let's do it tomorrow, though. I'm starving. I haven't eaten for two days!

Haaf2: Aren't you?
boy2: Not always ... it's complicated. All I'm doing is looking for my dog.

ing2-x: Boyle, get them!
boy2-a: Hey ^I'm the ex-overlord here.
boy2: Myst, get them!
Melvor2: ^WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIT!
Melvor2: Perhaps there is another way to resolve this. 
boy2: Fine ...
boy2: Ingrid, turn them all into creatures.
ing2-x: Why didn't I think of that?
Melvor2: No!! I mean, a non-violent way.
ing2-a: Non-violence? What has that ever solved?
boy2: Absolutely nothing.
24: I agree. All this senseless non-violence has to stop!  
28: We haven't even used our witch-burning stake ^a ^single ^time since we got it. 
Melvor2: Just hear me out!
Melvor2: The Boyle we met in that cave was a hero!
boy2: I helped you only so I could save Fang.
boy2: I would do anything for Fang.
29: ^Anything, you say? That's interesting.
29: Perhaps we ^can reach some kind of agreement.

28: Now, now, Allen. We have no way of proving that. 
24: Close your loud mouth before it gets you into more trouble, Allen. 
ing2: We'll do it, but you have to give us access to your magic store. 
28: Deal.
mys2: And the general store!
28: You can make use of any of our stores.
28: But don't you even ^think about leaving Windshire!
25: And while you're in there ...

89: Boyle, somebody wants to speak to you.
91: Boyle, I am so sorry that I implied you were the one who caused the windmill to stop working.

91: I embarrassed myself. As recompense, I stubbed my toe hard on the kitchen table. 
boy-w: You didn't have to- $end
91: And I will do it each morning! So as to never forget the pain I cause when I open my ^loud mouth!

boy-c: Hmmm ...
boy: ^Almost as rewarding. 
boy: Only now, instead of having people seeking revenge against me ... I have them seeking  forgiveness.

Mayor: You never polished my shoes after I beat you in two card flip all those years ago! 
boy-a: That wasn't a fair game, you cheated!
Mayor: Cheating is the whole ^point of the game!
Mayor: It's time for you to pay up, Boyle.
boy-s: Fine ... where are your shoes?
Mayor: Oh, if only it were that easy! Ah heh heh heh. $w.45 Heh. 
Mayor: I no longer own those shoes. Now, I want something else from you. 
boy-a: Never! I challenge you to a game of two card flip! 
boy: No, two games! The ^first to cancel my debt, and the ^second for your town!

Mayor: I gladly accept!

Mayor: Never mind that, you still have the know-how.
Mayor: You ^did almost rule Tor at one point, remember? 
boy: Tell me what you want.
Mayor: I need you to shut down one of the stores here in Tor. 
boy-c: Why would you want to close a store in your own town? 
Mayor: The shopkeeper is selling relics of the kobolds from Dragon Wasteland. 
Mayor: I don't know what he's up to, but it's certainly not good. 
boy: Why can't ^you kick him out?
Mayor: If I'm involved, people will find out and start asking questions. 
Mayor: I need this to go away quietly.
Mayor: You, on the other hand ... that's kind of your goal in life, isn't it? 
boy: I told you I'm not evil anymore.
mys-h: These days he's just kind of grumpy!
Mayor: Do this for me, and maybe I'll let you see your pet Fang again. 
Mayor: I believe my daughter has been taking good care of him for you. 
boy-a: Let me see him now!
Mayor: Having him here keeps you bound to Tor.
Mayor: I can't risk having you skip town again.
boy: I was  ^chased ^out by a horde of overzealous paladins! 
Mayor: Oh, they were just kidding around!
boy-a: Well it wasn't funny to me!
mys-c: Could this traumatic experience have led to Boyle's irrational fear of paladins? 
boy: I didn't say it was traumatic! I just said they were overzealous. 
ing-h: Yep, I'd say that's why he's scared of paladins. 
Mayor: Better get going. Don't mention me!
Mayor: Come see me at home when you're finished.

boy: Fang is an expert tracker. He could track them.

Event 64: S.George

Event 23: EV023
boy: Fang! How in the world did you end up in this disgusting, wretched wasteland? 
boy: Never mind, we're together again at last. My quest is complete. 
22: ^Hoooooooold ^it!
22: What is the meaning of this?
boy: This is my dog, Fang. He's coming with me.
22: I'm sorry, but he's mine. I found him in the Dragon Wasteland wandering around. 
22: Were it not for me, he'd be dragon food by now.
boy: I'm glad you saved him, but I'll be taking him now.
22: You'd have to buy him from me ...
boy: Name your price! Myself and my party will spare no expense to recover Fang. 
22: My price is 400 gold coins. Or at least it was ... he sold almost immediately. 
boy-w: To who!?
22: The lord of the tournament grounds.
boy-a: ^What? They're going to make my Fang fight? We have to save him. Quick, to the colosseum! 
ing: He's a storm wolf. They love fighting ... he'll probably enjoy himself. 
boy-a: He's a puppy! He wouldn't hurt anybody!
ing: We're supposed to be commandeering a ship.
boy: Fang takes precedence! To the colosseum!
22: Don't forget, I have an assortment of other animals available, should anything take your fancy. 
boy-a: We're not interested!

Event 21: EV021
mys-w: Boyle! Do you see that?
boy: It's a cage.

Event 39: EV039
row2-h: Hi guys!
rob-h: Oh, hello Rowen! Fancy meeting you here!
mys: Thanks for telling us about the end of the world!
row2: Don't mention it. 
row2: You guys get around a lot. You must live pretty eventful lives. 
row2: So what did you end up doing after the failed boat scheme? 
boy-w: How do you know about that?
mys: She's a mystic's apprentice.
boy: Ahh, he probably told you, right?
row2-x: Well ... not exactly.
row2: He's not even a real mystic.
boy-w: ^What?!
row2-w: Oh! I thought you'd figured that out by now ... 
row2: He only gives predictions that are in the customer's best interests. 
row2: Then he sends me off to make sure they come true. 
row2: Why did you think his powers only went as far as Tor? 
boy: I ^knew it!
row2-w: Oh! One second!
37: My lost ring! The Mystic was right!
row2: Anyway, I've had my eye on you guys for a while. I know a lot about your quest. 
row2-h: I ^also might know where you can get a ship, as well as a captain! 
boy-w: You do? ^Where?
row2-c: Ummm, right here ...
boy-c: There's a captain in ^Tor?
row2-x: Yeah ... I was actually talking about myself.
boy-w: ^You?
row2-x: Back in my homeland, there is an ancient warship from ages past. 
row2: I can probably get it for us.
boy-h: Sounds good to me!
row2-s: There's just one tiny little problem ...
row2: The Mystic paid a visit to my hometown a few years ago. 
row2: He was so impressed with my knowledge that he paid a witch to cast a curse on me. 
ing-w: ...
row2-s: So long as the curse remains, I'm under his control and I cannot leave Tor. 
rob-s: You must ^really miss your family!
row2-x: Well ... I suppose. But I've always craved a life of adventure. 
row2: It would be really nice if I could leave Tor.
ing: Sounds like the work of my sister.
boy-w: ^Another sister?
ing: Don't worry, Jinx is a lot more approachable than the rest. 
ing: She'd probably make us a deal.
ing: She lives in Mudsludge Swamp.

Event 36: EV036
rob2: So what's the plan here? Are we going to kidnap them? 
boy2: No.
ing2-h: We're going to poison them, right?
boy2: No.
mys2: Reveal what the mayor told us and hope they agree to the terms? 
boy2: Absolutely not!
boy2: We're going to do the first thing all great evil geniuses do ... gather information. 
rob2: And then we kidnap them?
boy2: The method will depend on the situation.
boy2: At the moment, a kidnapping is the most likely - 
rob2-h: Yes!
boy2-a: But it is by no means a given!
ing2-c: Ummm, Boyle ...
boy2: Yes?
ing2-s: I was certain it was going to be poison ... 
ing2: I already took the lid off this old potion I found in bottom of my bag. 
ing2: If we don't use it soon, it will go bad.
boy2: So throw it out.
ing2: It seems kind of irresponsible to just throw away something this destructive. 
boy2: You make a good point. Alright, use it on Robin. We'll see what happens. 
mys2: No! Don't you do that.
rob2: It's okay, Myst. If it helps Ingrid to ^gather ^information on the potion, it helps everybody. 
mys2-c: ...
boy2: Clever boy! Now you're starting to gain my respect. 
mys2-a: You're just taking advantage of his admiration for you! 
boy2: Of course I am. Why wouldn't I?
rob2: All right, let's see what this thing does!
mys2-c: ... well?
rob2-x: ...
rob2-x: Never better! $w.30 HYARP!
mys2-w: Oh no ... what have they done to you?
rob2-x: Right behind you, guys! $w.100 HYARP! $w.20 
boy2: Seems normal to me. Come on, let's go inside.

Event 83: S.Ceanna
this: Tor is a very unfriendly place.
this: I feed off that type of energy.
this: I treat people with as little respect as possible.
this: But then again, it ^is nice to be appreciated every once in a while. 
this: Perhaps if I appreciated others more, I would be appreciated more myself. 
this: Maybe my bad attitude is just my broken soul screaming out for help. 
this: Let's put a stop to the nastiness and seek forgiveness from the oracle of Aveyond! 
boy: Time to go back to Aveyond.
this: That terrible place!? I wouldn't last one second there! 
ing: You're not fooling anybody.
ing: You need to return to Aveyond.
ing: The oracle is stone cold.
this: Did you address her courteously?
ing: No, I mean, she's a rock.
this: She's gotten me through a trying time or two.
ing: She's statuesque. 
this: Not my place to comment on that.
ing-a: Go to Aveyond!
this: Fine, I'm going.
boy: You need to work on your delivery.

Event 54: S.Priscilla
this: If you're looking to sail out of Tor, be careful, there are pirates out there. 
this: If you stray from the trade route even a bit, well ... I wouldn't want to be you. 
this: I've heard rumors they even have a kraken!

Event 51: S.Geneva
this: Tor is more of a traveller's hub than a community.
this: People come here to fight, trade or hide.
this: Still, it will always be home to me.

mys-c: So ... should we fight?
Gimble: You'll get no aggression from me. Look around you, we're in prison. 
Gimble: Old allegiances don't count for anything in here. 
Gimble: Besides, if I defeat you, who will keep me company? 
mys: Maybe we can escape if we work together.
Gimble: An escape plan has been devised and is already in action. 
mys-h: Great! What is it?
Gimble: I've been gnawing away at those steel bars a bit each day. 
Gimble: I can only do it for so long before I pass out.
mys-s: Oh my ...
Gimble: Now, with you here, we can gnaw at them twice as fast! 
Gimble: A few solid days of effort and we'll be free! 
mys-s: I ... guess ...
mys: Actually, I've got a better plan.
Gimble: Better than mine? I doubt it.
mys: Throw me over the bars. Once I'm out, I'll get the key and release you. 
Gimble: I'm not a troll, I couldn't throw you that high.
Gimble: And I don't know why you think there would be a key in here. 
mys: I'm a mist wraith, I'm very light. And the key is just over there. 
Gimble: I don't see anything. How can you tell?
mys: I'm a creature of the forest. I have heightened senses. 
Gimble: You weave an interesting tale, I'll give you that. 
Gimble: I know I have no reason to trust you, but the idea of tossing you over that cage excites me. 
Gimble: I've long looked upon those trolls with childish wonder, imagining what it must be like ... 
Gimble: Let's do it.
Gimble: I did it!
mys: I'll get you out.

boy3-a: Never!
ing3: Boyle, you can't question a two-card flip obligation! What is wrong with you? 
boy3: He cheated!
ing3-a: That's the entire point of the game.
ing3: Fetch his cheese, then we'll try to convince him some other way. 
boy3: Fine, but I'm going to get the ^oldest looking one! 
9: I love vintage cheese!
this: Fetch me a round of cheese!
boy: Here's your cheese.
this: Good.
ing: So what should we try next?
rob: ...
rob-a: I challenge you to a game of two card flip!
boy-c; Really? You think you have a chance? You're far too innocent for two card flip. do you even know  how to play? 
rob: I ... have not played before. But it seems fairly straightforward. 
rob-h: And I'm a fast learner!
boy: Two card flip is both extremely simple and endlessly complicated. 
boy: It's all about cunning, deception and ingenuity. You'd have no chance. 
rob-s: Come on, let me try!
boy: I guess there's no harm. It will be funny to witness the cruel and unusual punishment. 
rob: I ... ummm ... need to borrow your deck.
boy: ^Never! I spent years building this thing. Do you know how many card shops I've visited around the  world? 
rob-s: But I don't have a deck ...
boy: Fine, you may ^borrow it. But if you bind ^one ^single ^card, I'm going to be ^very upset with you. 
rob-h: Understood!
rob2: So, Edgar, you know my terms for the battle. What are yours? 
9: If you lose ... you have to ^tear ^up ^that ^deck ^of ^cards!!! 
9: Mwa ha ha ha ha!
boy2-a: No!
ing2: I didn't know paladins could be so spiteful.
9: Well ... now you know! Ha ha ha ha!
boy2-s: My cards ... my precious cards.
rob2-w: On second thought, let's not have this match. 
boy2-a: Your offer has been accepted, you can't change your mind, you fool! 
rob2: I'm really sorry about this. I'll get you a new deck! 
9: So, shall we play?
rob2-a: Let's do it!

rob2-a: ^Crab! I win!!!
rob2-w: I win!
rob2-h: I WIN!
boy2-w: What in the world? He did it! But how?
9: That devil! I couldn't get a single read on him!
9: How is it possible for me to be outplayed like this? I used to be a champion! 
rob2-h: Ha ha! You lose, now ^tear ^up ^your ^deck!
boy2-w: No! The crusade.
rob2-s: Oh, right ...
rob2: You have to join the crusade.
9: Darn. Well, a deal's a deal. I look forward to dying beside you. 
rob2: Likewise.
boy2: We're not going to die, we're going to win.
9: This your first crusade, then?
boy2-a: Just be quiet and sign up.
rob2: Want your deck back, Boyle?
boy2: You hold onto it for now. You might need it again. 
boy2: Besides, I've never won a match with it.

Mist Queen: So he will help us?
mys3: He has one condition. He asks that the mist be cleared up so he can find his pet. 
Mist Queen: Very well, I will clear the mist for the time being, but it can just as easily return. 
Mist Queen: As for his four-legs, I'm afraid he is no longer within my area of influence. 
mys3-c: What do you mean?
Mist Queen: He ventured beyond the mist. I cannot sense him any longer. 
mys3: Boyle will not be happy.
Mist Queen: If he values his home, he will do well to keep on my good side. 
mys3: Have you any idea in which direction the wolf wandered? 
Mist Queen: I covered the island, so he has gone at least as far as the mainland. 
mys3: Very well.

Event 3: EV003

mys2: No, mother, but I did find this human.
mys2: His friend, a four-legs, is lost in the mountains. He wishes for you to help him. 
Mist Queen: I have no desire to help this human. It was a human who stole my son. 
boy: What happened to your son? Does this have something to do with the mist? 
mys2: A man stole my brother, Whisp, last night. He's only a baby. 
mys2: He won't survive without the mist for long.
Mist Queen: My daughter is correct. I will cover the entire world in mist if I must, to protect him. 
Mist Queen: Leave, human, I cannot stand the sight of you. 
boy: But nothing can survive in this mist you are creating. Many creatures will die! 
Mist Queen: I do not care for the lives of mortal creatures.  
Mist Queen: Unless my son is returned to me, I shall cover the world in a mist so thick that none will  survive. 
boy-s: But ... Fang ...
Mist Queen: That's enough! You had your chance to leave. 
boy-w: I knew it was a trap. I can't see!

ing: Unlike your crafts, your enslavement curse is really impressive. You should stick to that. 
this: But I have. Do you think these girls joined my coven of their own free will? 
ing-w: You mean ... they're ^all cursed?
this: Not anymore.
this: The curses wore off, but the love of crafting remained. 
this: If you like, you can join my coven and learn a few enslavement spells of your own. 
this: ^And you can join our crafting sessions!
ing: I'll think about it. But crafting is definitely out of the question. 
this: Thought about my offer?
ing-c: If I join your coven, I won't be able to join a different one. 
@a: Join coven
@b: Think about it
ing: Okay, but I'm only joining for the enslavement magic, not the crafting. 
this: That's what they all say.
this: Here's your hat.
ing: Wow, this thing is great!
this: See? You've warmed up to my crafting already.
ing-a: How about you teach me some enslavement magic now. 
this: Enslavement magic can't be taught so easily.
this: You'll have to start small and work your way up.
this: There is a weak-willed man in Tor that we use for practice. 
this: Convince him to do something against his will and you'll be ready to learn. 
ing: No, the crafting ruins it for me.
this: Let me know if you change your mind.
this: There is a weak-willed man in Tor that we use for practice. 
this: Convince him to do something against his will and you'll be ready to learn. 
ing: I successfully enslaved the weak-willed man.
this: I wouldn't go that far, but you did good.
this: Time for your next task.
this: I need some mageweave cloth from an elven tailor. 
this: It's for a $w.45 curse.
ing: I'm sure it is ...
this: I'll be able to teach you something when you bring it to me.

this: Our production line has slowed a bit. I think we need to recruit a new member. 
this: Keep an eye out for any witches who might like to join. 
ing: I've enslaved a witch to join the coven.
this: I'm pretty sure she was already looking to join, but a good job nonetheless. 
this: Your next task will be one of intermediate enslavement. 
this: You're to convince a mid-willed girl to do something $w.45 ^against ^her ^will. 
this: There is one such girl in Windshire.
this: Find her, and break her will.
this: You're to convince a mid-willed man to do something $w.45 ^against ^his ^will. 
this: There is one such man in Windshire.
ing: The girl in Windshire has been enslaved.
ing: She ate a carrot.
this: Not quite enslavement, but you're learning.
this: I think it's time to teach you a new spell.
this: But I still feel you are not yet ready.
this: You'll need to complete another task first.
this: Sell this in your store.
ing-a: I'm not selling more of your junk!
this: This is very important. Do you want to learn a new spell? 
this: Sell that item in your store and you'll have proven you're ready to learn more. 
ing-a: There, I sold your stupid crafts.
this: Good work.
this: It seems my enslavement abilities are growing exponentially. 
ing-c: What?
this: I mean yours. $w.30 Your enslavement skills are growing exponentially. 
this: You're definitely ready to learn this now.
sys: Ingrid learns a new spell.
this: Ingrid.
this: The time is drawing near.
this: The time in which I will teach you the ultimate enslavement spell. 
this: But I'll need some help getting everything I need.
this: First, I'll need you to bring me a top secret recipe. 
this: I've heard rumors that it exists in an underground town in the Dragon Wasteland. 
this: So good luck.
this: First, I'll need you to bring me a top secret recipe. 
this: I've heard rumors that it exists in an underground town in the Dragon Wasteland. 
ing: Here's your recipe.
this: Wow, you found it!
this: It's time for your next enslavement test.
this: This is the hardest test I have.
this: You will need to convince an iron-willed woman to do something against her will. 
this: Yes, that's right, I'm talking about an Aveyond priestess. 
this: Find the most strong-willed priestess and work your curse. 
this: You will need to convince an iron-willed woman to do something against her will. 
this: Yes, that's right, I'm talking about an Aveyond priestess. 
this: Find the most strong-willed priestess and work your curse. 
ing: I did it! I convinced an Aveyond priestess to litter.
this: Good, she'll likely be told off by the oracle about that. 
ing: Are you going to teach me the ultimate enslavement spell now? 
this: Not quite. There is just one more thing you'll need to do first. 
this: I've made a few changes to the secret recipe you brought me. 
this: Now it's ready for you to make it.
sys: Ingrid learns a new potion spell.
this: Bring me the potion when you're done and it will be time to teach you the ultimate enslavement spell. 
this: Bring me the potion when you're done and it will be time to teach you the ultimate enslavement spell. 
ing: I don't know if the potion turned out right. It just made some stupid drink. 
this: Ahhh, my choco dream is ready!
sys: Jinx grabs the drink from Ingrid's hand and slurps it down. 
this: That sure hit the spot.
this: And with that, your training is complete.
this: You have just witnessed the ultimate enslavement. 
ing-c: What are you talking about?
this: The only person more stubborn than an Aveyond priestess is you, Ingrid. 
this: And you just brought me a choco dream.
this: ^And ran a few errands for me.
ing-a: How dare you do this to me!
this: Don't you see? Now that you understand enslavement, you can ^learn it. 
sys: Ingrid learns enslavement spell.
ing: Fine, I'll let you get away with it.
this: There is nothing left for me to teach you.
this: Unless you'd like to study some crafting ...
ing-a: No!
this: There is nothing more I can teach you now.
this: Would you like to join my coven now?
ing: I can't, I've already joined a different one.
this: That's a shame. I think you would have enjoyed enslavement magic. 

Event 5: S.Young Witch
this: I love crafting.
ing: How would you like to join a new coven?
this: Why would I do that? Crafting is my passion.
ing: Or is that just the enslavement talking?
this: If it was the enslavement talking, why would I get such satisfaction from my crafting? 
ing: Because your mind has been altered.
this: I don't care if it's real or not! Crafting makes me happy. Why would I stop? 
ing: What if you didn't have to stop?
ing: What if you could be responsible for crafting for an entire coven? 
this: Keep talking ...
ing: My sister is starting a coven of her own. I imagine we'll need all sorts of things made. 
this: Okay, I'll do it.
ing-h: Very good.

ing2-c: You've started that forsaken crafting again?
ing2-a: How many times did mother tell you that you have no talent? 
4: More than enough.
4: Leave me alone, Ingrid, I'm running a successful crafting coven here. 
ing2: Obviously not successful enough to stop you from selling curses. 
4: What are you talking about?
ing2: You've cursed one of the elves to be under the control of a mystic. 
ing2: And don't even try to deny it or I'll turn you into something even more unsightly than you already are. 
4: Fine, I do the odd curse here and there. But who doesn't? 
ing2: I need you to remove it.
4: Sorry, I can't do that. The mystic pays me good money each month to prolong the curse. 
4: I guess he doesn't realize that the curse is already permanent. 
ing2: ...
ing2: I admit, it's a pretty good scheme you've got going, but I require the elf to do my own bidding. 
4: I need that money. My crafting business isn't exactly profitable yet. 
ing2: ...
ing2-s: Fine.
ing2: You're my sister, so it really pains me to do this, but I'll sell your crafts for you. 
4: You'd do that for me?
ing2: I'll try, but I can't promise you anybody will buy them. 
ing2: After all, they're disgusting. Mother was right, you really have no talent. 
4: Thank you, Ingrid. All I ever wanted was a chance.
4: Here is the recipe for the antidote. 
4: Here, you'll need this too.
4: We use a trap to keep our moon tears safe in the Divisive Thicket. 
4: If you're interested, there's room for another witch in our coven. 
4: You never know, you might take to the crafting.
ing2-a: Yeah right!
4: I could teach you some enslavement spells in exchange ... 
ing2-s: Enslavement spells?
ing2: I wouldn't be able to join another coven if I joined yours, so I'll have to think about it. 
ing2: But, on the ^other hand ...
ing2-x: I'll let you know.

vn-mys-h: Hee hee! But he's just a dog ...
vn-boy: If your useless mother's only plan is to sit around and cover Wyrmwood in mist, I guess I'll have  to save that child myself. 
vn-mys: You're an interesting creature, Boyle Wolfbane. I have a feeling I'm still not done figuring  you out ...

boy-c: Ummm, excuse me over there.
39: Greetings, friends.
boy: May I ask what it is you're doing?
39: Isn't it obvious?
39: I came as soon as I heard about the crusade.
39: I've lost count of how many days I've been locked in battle with these demons. 
39: As soon as I kill one, another shows up.
39: And they have healers!
boy: I admire your resolve, but how are you not dead? 
39: I have a secret.
39: I've come here looking for my wife, and I can't leave until I find her. 
rob-h: How noble!

39: Ahhhh, it's finally over!
rob-w: Are you alright?
39: I think I'll just rest here for a bit.
boy: So, about Skull Mountain ...
39: Skull Mountain is a dangerous place. Reaching it will require a perilous journey through the mountains  to the north. 
39: And, if you happen across my wife, could you wake me up and let me know where she is? 
39: She has red hair. She shouldn't be too hard to spot. 
rob-h: It's the least we could do for you!
mys-h: You've fought bravely, kind paladin, but now it is time for you to rest. 
mys: Robin will take up your sword and fight in your name. 
39: Actually, I should probably keep it ...
mys-a: Let ^go!
mys-h: Here you go, Robin!
rob-w: I can't take that! He's still breathing!

boy-a: How dare you insult mine and Fang's friendship! 
boy: Colby is a minion, nothing more!
boy: I won't be showing him a ^single ounce of affection!

boy3: Why?

5: Very well. May I see your library card? Or would you like to apply for one? 
boy2: I don't need a card. I'm not going to ^borrow anything. 
5: Nobody may enter the library without a card.
boy2: Those things always take forever to sign up for! 
boy2: And I don't like answering ^personal questions.
5: Let's start with your name.
boy2: ... Fine. Robin.
rob2: What?
boy2: No,  I was saying my name is Robin.
rob2-c: I thought it was Boyle.
boy2-a: Now it's Robin.
5: I hope you are not being disingenuos. I do not appreciate disingenuity in my library. 
5: Unless it happens to be the word of the day.
boy2: Me? I assure you, I don't even know the meaning of the word. 
5: I'm ^very well-read. It's not that easy to pull the wool over my eyes. 
boy2: Have it your way. Robin, sign up for a library card. We'll go wait over there. 
rob2-h: Leave it to me!
mys2: I'll help you.
boy2-a: I can't believe this place!
ing2: It's very excluding. I don't see a ^single spell book in here! 
boy2: Anybody who called ^me evil never met a librarian. 
ing2: Who even reads books?
boy2: I try to, I just never have the time unfortunately.
ing2: Yeah, right! You don't even know how to read.
ing2: I always see you reading that spell book I gave you and you still haven't learned half them. 
boy2-a: I like to take my time and think about what I'm reading! 
ing2: Yeah, sure. Is Robin done yet?
rob2: I hereby swear, on my family, that I shall never borrow any book for longer than three days. 
boy2: Nope, he's still going.
ing2: I suppose we should start planning our wedding. 
boy2: Let's not get ahead of ourselves. You might find a nice troll in the castle dungeon. 
ing2: No, I'm pretty sure I've made up my mind.
ing2: The curse will activate whether I like it or not.
ing2: So, would you like me to invite your mother?
boy2-a: Ha ha.
ing2: Oh Boyle, I'm sure she's over it by now.
boy2: I told you never to speak of her.
ing2: Fine ...
rob2: So long as I continue to draw breath, my commitment to this library will take priority over all  else. 
ing2: What's going on over there?
boy2: Typical library stuff. Haven't you ever signed up for anything? 
ing2: No ...
ing2: A few unholy pacts maybe, a blood oath here and there ... but never anything serious. 
boy2: The trick is to use a fake name. That way, they can't bother you. 
rob2: Finished!
boy2: How did it go?
rob2-c: Ummm, pretty good. I wasn't certain on the spelling of Wolfmane, so I just took a guess. 
boy2: Wolf mane? What are you talking about?
rob2-c: Wolfmane ... Boyle Wolfmane.
boy2-a: ^What $w.30 ^did $w.30 ^you $w.30 ^do?!
rob2: Don't worry, I don't think they'll care about the spelling. It's a very odd name. 
rob2: I can't imagine they'd confuse you with anybody else. 
boy2-a: It's WolfBANE, you fool! And you were supposed to use ^your name, not mine! 
rob2-c: But you said ...
rob2-w: Oh ...
ing2-x: Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
ing2-h: So much for not giving them your name, hey ^Wolfmane? 
rob2-s: Sorry ...
boy2: Forget it. We'll just have to burn it to the ground when we leave. 
rob2: There are countless tales of paladins in here! We can't burn it down! 
boy2: ...
boy2-a: Fine, but if we borrow a book, I'm ^not going to return it. 
boy2-a: For at ^least ten days!
ing2: On account of your reading problems, right?
boy2: Come on then, let's start looking for this book.

Event 21: U.Notice2

Event 11: ing3

Map 121: Hercules Scene 2
----------------------------------------

Event 3: EV003
4: All is going to plan.
4: The Oracle fell right into our trap. The amulet I gave you worked wonders. 
4: Make sure you don't lose it.
1: Of course.
1: But what of the villains I met in Aveyond? Perhaps I should have used the amulet on them. 
4: There's no need to worry about them.
4: The blood moon is rapidly approaching.
4: As soon as my true form is returned, I will grant you the power to charm anybody. 
4: Together, we will see the world is safe from all who might seek to harm it. 
1: Yes, of course. It will be my most thrilling, and convincing, tale yet. 


Map 32: Wyrmwood
----------------------------------------

Event 32: EV032
boy2-w: No!
ing2: I told you to stop putting keys in those things, Boyle. 
boy2-a: Hercules owes me a gargoyle!
mys: Well, I guess your gemstone is gone now.
boy2-a: Who cares about the gemstone. Look at my house! 
boy2: I don't have a single nice thing anymore.
boy2: I'm the exact same as everybody else in this town. 
rob2-a: We'll get you a new gargoyle, Boyle!
rob2: Right guys?
mys2-h: Sure.
ing2: ... fine.
boy2-c: Why would you guys get me another gargoyle? 
rob2-h: Because that's what friends are for.
boy2-s: I didn't used to need friends. $w.45 I had gargoyles. 
boy2: And Fang.

Event 37: C.Payne
this: With the festival over, it's back to another day of selling my wares. 
this: So what can I do for you?
@a: Buy
@b: Sell
this: What can I do to ease your pain?
@a: Buy
@b: Sell

Event 27: T.Boyle's House
ing: Locked.
mys-w: Oh no, it's ^locked!
ing: I bet he keeps a spare key around here somewhere. 

Event 20: S.Hadir
this: It can be hard living in a town of retired villains.
this: Everybody here has such an ego about themselves. 
mys-c: You seem normal, why do you live here?
this: I married into it.

Event 14: U
ing: This looks like it belongs to Boyle.
boy: How did you end up with ^my gargoyle?
16: Nobody claimed it so I swooped in and bought it with the one ticket I was able to hide from you. 
boy-a: I demand you return it to me now!
16: If I recall correctly, you were about to waste your tickets on a collar for that dog of yours. 
ing: As good as it felt to break your last gargoyle, I suppose I do owe you a new one. 
ing: What do you want for it?
16: I want a potion that will make everything I touch turn to gold! 
ing-x: I can't do that, but I could turn you into a frog if you like. 
16: You know what, I don't want the gargoyle that much anyway. 
boy-h: So I can take it!?
16: Yeah, go ahead.
boy2-h: Ahh, it feels great having a gargoyle again.
ing2: It's lovely, Boyle, but did you really have to put your spare key in its eye again? 
boy2-c: Where else would I put it?
ing2: Perhaps into something that you don't want broken? 
boy2: Nobody would think to look in the eye of a gargoyle. 
boy2: They'd be too intimidated by it.
ing2: If you say so ...
mys2: So can we finally leave here now?
ing2: Yes, we need to get to the Shadow Isles before the blood moon. 
boy2: We'll head to Tor. We'll have a chance to look for Fang on the way, and we can get a ship once  we get there. 
boy2: We can get to Tor by going through the Briar Woods. 

Event 17: U
boy: I have a haunch I'd regret purchasing this.

Event 3: U
ing: Who does Boyle think he's fooling with this thing?
ing: Leave it to Boyle to hide the key in the most obvious place. 
mys-w: Ingrid, you broke it!
ing: Heh. Oops.
mys: Boyle is going to be furious!
ing: We're saving his life, he'll have to live with it.

Event 36: S.Prince Thornheart
this: The Mist Mountains are so large that they cast a shadow over our town at all times of day. 
this: That's why it always appears to be night.

Event 19: U
boy: I have a haunch I'd regret purchasing this.

Event 13: S.Cosmina
this: Sometimes I wonder if it's even worth being evil anymore. 
ing: I've wondered that myself before.
this: Are we really the great former evil beings we make ourselves out to be? 
this: Or are we just fooling ourselves?
this: Were we doomed to this life of evil, or did we really choose it for ourselves? 
this: I love causing trouble.
this: But I'd be lying if I said it didn't wear on my soul.
this: This is going to sound strange, but sometimes I find it more rewarding to contribute, rather than  destroy. 
ing: That ^does sound strange.
this: Helping people has become a more common pastime for me recently. 
this: It's surprisingly rewarding.
this: Have ^you $w.45 tried it?
ing-a: Never.
this: Maybe you should.
this: It's kind of fun, in a backwards sort of way.
this: The time has come to renounce our evil ways and seek forgiveness from the oracle of Aveyond. 
this: Will you join me?
ing-x: But being evil is ^so much fun!
this: That's what I ^used to think- $end
ing: Alright, that's enough. I know you're a priestess.
this: What!?
this: Speak not such horrible words to me!
this: The mere thought of one of those things scalds my brain! 
ing: Aveyond is in danger, the oracle has been turned to stone. 
ing: You need to return immediately.
this: Fine, I'm going.
this: But my work here is not yet complete.

Event 29: T
ing: I guess the raven lord is out.

Event 53: T.Wyrmwood *B
ing: We shouldn't go there without Boyle.

Event 2: S.Margaret
this: Hi Ingrid. What happened to Boyle?
ing: Spider.
this: Get away from me Boyle! I know what you're up to! I've been cultivating this pumpkin garden for an  entire year! 
Boy: What am I going to do to it?
this: Don't think I haven't noticed Hellemy looking at my pumpkin garden with that amber glow in his eyes! 
this: You're always scheming with him. I can tell when you've got pumpkin on the brain. 

Event 33: U
boy: You're all I have left in this world.

Event 26: T.Ingrid's House
ing: Wait outside.
ing: I have a lot of valuable things.

boy: I have a haunch I'd regret purchasing this.

Event 16: S.Laguna Le Rouge
ing: The festival is over. Why is your stuff still here?

me: Bring 10 to the magic shop in Tor.
@a: Accept
@b: Deny
boy: We can do this.
boy: I don't like magic.

mys2: It's quite shiny.
mys2-c: Looks like a knife.
ing2-w: A knife? Like the kind I use?
mys2: Maybe.
ing2-x: Get it out! Get it out!
mys2: I can't reach it.
ing2: I need that knife!
mys2: It's too cramped. We'll have to come back later.
ing2-x: I need it ^now!
boy2-c: Ingrid ... you've turned Myst into a snake!
ing2-w: I did?
ing2-h: I did!
ing2-x: I learned a new transformation!!!
ing2-h: Now get me that knife!
ing2-x: This will do nicely!

Event 70: EV070
row-h: Ahaa!
row-h: They were using Draaghar artifacts after all!
row: This should give us access to the ancient caves. 
row-x: And one of ^those should lead us to the Draaghars! 

Event 54: U.BabyBlocker
boy: It looks magical.

Event 53: EV053
rob: I think we made it just in time!

x-boy3: What's going on?
x-ing3-w: I think ... it's hatching!
x-mys-w: Should we run away?
ing3-w: It's ... a dragon!
boy3: Our ^very ^own dragon?
ing3: It looks like it.

x-mys-h: We'll swoop down on the mountain top and rescue my brother!

vn-ing-a: Do you idiots have any idea how long it takes for a dragon to reach maturity? 
vn-boy-s: Oh ...
vn-rob-s: I thought ...
vn-mys-s: Sorry ...
vn-ing: Its small size will make it the perfect tool for heating up my potions! 
vn-ing: And when it grows up ...
vn-ing-x: ^I will be the one riding it!
vn-ing: Let's go and tell the mayor about what happened. 

Event 125: U.cheeki

Event 2: EV002
ing4: There you are! How did you get here so fast?
1: I flew my broomstick. Where's yours? Is it invisible? 
boy4-h: Ah ha ha! In a manner of speaking!
ing4-a: Be quiet! This sorry crew depends on me being around so there's no use having it with me. 
1: There should be a nice bone we can use around here somewhere. 
1: He'll do.
ing4-w: !!!
1: What's wrong? Did I do something wrong?
ing4-w: Where did you learn to do ^that?
1: I don't know ... I just kind of figured it out.
1: It's my death curse. It kills pretty much anything except massive creatures. 
ing4-w: ...
1: Are you proud of me?
rob4: ^That $w.30 ^was $w.30 ^AMAZING!
rob4: Can you teach Ingrid how to do that?
ing4-a: I have no use for such things. My potions get me through anything. 
ing4-x: Just ask Boyle! Ha ha ha ha ha!
ing4-a: Give me that thing!
1: Hey Ingrid, do you think I could join you guys on your quest? 
rob4-h: Absolutely!
ing4: Absolutely not. 
ing4: We've got enough brats already, don't need another one. 
1: Okay then ... it's just I was hoping to start a coven ... 
1: You know, so I could teach my arts to other witches. 
1: If I came with you, I'd be able to recruit other witches at the same time. 
ing4: Teach your arts, you say?
ing4: I'll tell you what, I ^may come and see you about it later. 
ing4: If I decide to run this coven, I won't be able to join any others. 
ing4: But on the other hand, a curse which kills enemies could come in handy ... 
1: If you decide to lead it? You mean my coven would belong to you? 
ing4: Yes, of course.
1: ...
1: $.1 That would be the BEST $w.30 THING $w.30 EVER! $s.3 
1: You'd be ^SO ^GOOD ^AT ^IT!
ing4: I said ^maybe. I ^may come and see you.
ing4: Right now, we have a potion recipe to track  down. 
1: The guy said he lived in Tor. He was wearing all black. 
1: I'll head home! I'll wait for you to come visit so we can start our coven!

vn-rob: This must be the one. Come on, let's go tell Galahad. 
this: Why are you asking about my husband?
this: Thank you for collecting my husband for me.
this: Oh, you brought me three blood samples!
boy: Not a problem.
boy: So what are you going to do with them?

Event 4: U
boy: Alright, I guess we're supposed to fill the bucket with water. 
rob: Fascinating! I feel like we should make a wish or something. 
rob: My nan says a little man lives at the bottom of every well. 
boy-c: You haven't had many good male role models in your life, have you, Robin? 
rob-s: My nan tried to raise me to be the best man she could. 
boy: That's okay, I never had any male role models either. 
rob: Who taught you your leadership qualities?
boy: Well, it certainly wasn't my nan.
rob: Nan believes children should be quiet and submissive. 
boy: Robin, if you ever want to be taken seriously, you've got to stop listening to your nan. 
rob-s: I don't know if nan would approve ...
boy: From now on, consider ^me your nan.
rob-w: You?!
rob-c: I don't know, Boyle, those are some pretty big shoes to fill. 
rob-a: But you're right! I do want to be more like you.
rob: Thanks for looking out for me!
boy: Well, I have to pass on my wisdom to somebody.
boy: Let's keep this between us.
rob-h: Of course!

boy: Let's get this thing back.

Event 6: T.Back

Event 2: EV002
1: Why, hello there.
1: I wasn't expecting company.
boy: I hear you are a master craftsman.
1: Well, I don't know about that ... but I do try my best.
boy: We came a long way to speak to you. I need something from you. 
1: Hold on, hold on!
1: I refuse to talk business until I introduce you to my family. 
ing: I don't see anybody around.
1: Please, come over here.
1: This here is my wife.
boy-c: Ummm ...
1: She's shy. Go ahead and say hello.
boy-c: But this is a -
rob-h: Hello there, Misses Mister Carpenter! Pleased to meet you! 
rob-c: Did she say anything back?
1: I didn't hear anything.
1: Maybe she's asleep.
1: Come say hi to my son.
1: This is my son.
1: As you can tell, he is very much awake!
boy-s: Yes, of course ...
boy: So, I was wondering if you could make me some furniture. 
1: I'd love to.
1: Let's talk inside. I'll have my wife make us drinks.
1: Oh ...
boy: What's wrong?
1: There is no water left ...
1: Would you mind taking my son up to the well to fetch some water? 
1: He's rather good at it. You shouldn't have much trouble. 
boy: Yes, well he looks water tight ...
1: What?
boy: Never mind.
1: Why don't you ladies come inside while the lads head up to the well. 
ing: Sounds good to me!
boy: Sure ...
boy: Just me and you, Robin.

Event 55: U.Web
boy: What treachery is this?
boy-w: I can't reach the money bag!
???1: Your riches won't save you from Fangder's merciless bite. 

Event 12: U.Mir Tree4
This: It would be unwise to cross me!
This: I am not just a mir tree. I am the tree which the other trees fear. 
boy: I've dealt with you before. Your bark is a lot worse than your bite. 
This: Thanks for noticing! It's actually a fortified cedar wood, which is much stronger than pine ... 
This: Wait, you were teasing me, weren't you?
This: Well that was embarrassing.

Event 7: U.Moneybag
boy: I went through some very dark times in my years as a villain. 
boy: But no matter how bad it got, there always remained a shining beacon that called out through the  dark. 
boy: Yes, the money bag, and its promise of free gold. Even at my most evil, I always saw good in you. 

Event 53: U.Web
boy: It's too strong, I'd never make it.
???4: Fangder never forgets ...

Event 45: U.Fairy2
boy-h: Ha! Got you now.
Chester3: Nice work!
boy-c: So what happens now that I've caught him?
Chester3: Oh, you'll like this part!
boy-w: What just happened?
Chester3: Don't worry, I didn't hurt him.
Chester3: Go on, try out your new powers.
???2: You will regret burning Fangder's web.
boy-c: What was that sound?
Chester3: I didn't hear anything.
boy: Oh well.
boy-h: My old powers! They're returning!
boy-c: But how?
Chester3: That is a story for another time.
Chester3: For now, chase down any of those things you find and bring them to me. That is, if you desire  power. 
boy: Where can I find you?
Chester3: Oh ... around. Heh heh.
boy: I guess I'll keep a look out for more of those things. 

Event 6: U.Mir Tree3
boy: I've come for your mir wood.
This: No problem. None at all. It's yours. Take as much as you like. 
boy-h: Really?
This: No!
This: You only won because I'm a tree.

Event 9: U.Mir Tree
boy: All right, here goes ...
boy-a: Relinquish the mir wood or I'll take it with force. 
this: Be gone, pest! I only give mir wood to those who deserve it! 
boy: How about you don't be difficult this time? We both know I'm getting that mir wood either way. 
this: Just try it and see how it turns out for you!
boy: Well, you're no Elder Oak.
this: And you're no Ahriman!
boy: But at least I've got mir wood.
boy: Now, reveal the locations of your kin!
this: They're trees so they probably haven't moved since the last time you accosted them. 
boy-h: I only need your wood, not your tears.
this: ... It's sap.
This: If there were more sunlight in these woods, things would have ended differently. 

Event 8: EV008
boy-a: If I get a ^single splinter ...
boy-h: ^I'm not helping clean up tomorrow morning!

Event 4: S.Chester2

Event 11: U.Mir Tree2
this: You'll get nothing from me today, Boyle.
boy: Is that so?
this: I'm above these petty games now.
this: As long as I don't play along, there's ^nothing you can do to me! 
this: Errr ... could you help me out here?
boy: I thought you were above talking to me.
this: I'll ^give you the mir wood. I don't even need it!
this: Here, I'll break it off myself.
boy: See how easy that was?
this: I hope you won't tell anybody what transpired here.  

Event 16: S.Chester
this: Nothing to see here ... please carry on.
boy: I need to see a mir about a log.

Event 10: EV010
x-boy: Well, there's the mir tree.
x-boy: It's not going to be fun, but as Ingrid says, somebody has to do it. 
x-boy: I suppose I can't blame her. Who else is capable of such a thing? 

Event 52: U.Web
boy: It's too strong, I'd never make it.
???3: Keep burning Fangder's webs ... see what happens ... 

Event 14: EV014
Chester2: Oh ... hello again. I kind of wish you didn't see that. 
Chester2: Fine, I've revealed myself now, I may as well involve you in this. 
boy: Actually, I'm kind of busy with something else.
Chester2: Too late. You've seen too much.
Chester2: And trust me, you'll enjoy this.
Chester2: First, catch that little critter for me. I'll wait.

Event 13: EV013
x-boy: Ingrid would tan my hide if I went back without the Mir Wood.

Event 54: S.Clay
this: It's too dangerous to enter the woods at night.

Event 15: EV015
boy: So how do we do this?
boy: I think Ingrid should have to hold her down, because she already has her foul taint on here. 
boy: Myst, you administer the potion while I oversee the whole thing. 
ing: No.
ing: Here's what we're really going to do - Boyle, you'll sit down to a cup of tea with her. 
boy-a: Why would I drink tea with that wretch?
ing: If she's the only one that drinks it, she'll think something is up. Trust me, it's the only way. 
boy-a: Argh! Fine, just don't get the drinks mixed up!
ing-h: Don't worry, I won't.

Event 4: U.Job Board

this: Not a ^single thing could convince me!
this: Save, perhaps, for a game of two card flip.
boy: Done, let's go.
this: No ... not against you. Against the witch.
ing: Sorry, I don't play unless I have something to gain. 
boy: Come on Ingrid, this is the only way.
ing: I don't play so fast and loose with the two card flip, Boyle. I'm not risking being at this man's mercy  for a stupid crusade. 
boy: If you lose, I'll let you have my throne.
ing: The cool bone one? Fine, I'll play.
ing2: So what are you terms then, paladin?
21: Nothing too complicated. Should you lose, you will return to Castle Town $w.45 and ^marry ^the ^king! 
ing2-c: Marry the king? That's absurd. Why would you want - 
ing2-a: Wait a minute ...
ing2-a: You ^sneak! Get out of here!
21: Too late! All two card flip challenges are final. Face me, and become my wife! 
ing2: I can't. I'm already promised to another.
21: It matters not!
21: Commence!
21: Heroine!
ing2: Creep.
21: ^Wayward ^daughter!
ing2-h: Swamp rat. You lose!
21: ^Nooooooo!
21: I was so close!!!
21: Fine, you've ruined me. I guess I'll just slink back to my castle now. 
ing2: Nice try, you're joining the crusade.
21: Surely you jest! I am not a warrior.
ing2: You're the king, register yourself as one. You know the rules of two card flip. You have to do  whatever I want. 
21: $s.1 Surely $w.45 $s.3 you jest.
ing2: I almost had to marry you! You're getting off lightly compared to that.  
ing2: Just be thankful we have to save the world or you'd be doing something a ^lot less dignified. 
21: I find your cruelty intoxicating.

Grunhilda: Describe the perfect evening for yourself.

Grunhilda: And what about you?

45: After that, a quick supper and straight to bed.
Grunhilda: Please, say something different.

Grunhilda: Fine, just tell me the truth.

ing5-c: Why?
boy5: We have no business talking to that wretch. We'll just get in the way. 
ing5: Oh come on boyle, do you think I'd let her ^curse you? 
boy5: Myst is still innocent, she doesn't need to lay eyes on that creature. 
ing5-a: Fine, have it your way! She'll be at our wedding and you won't be able to hide from her then! 
mys: Congratulations on your wedding, Boyle.
boy-s: It's not what you think ...
mys-h: I know things are different here but weddings are still very much a part of my culture! 
mys: I look forward to my wedding day. 
mys: I hope we rescue my brother soon so I may begin searching for a mate. 
mys-s: I'm already quite behind. 
boy: I'm sure Ingrid could help you take care of that.
mys: I'd never marry a man from this place. Mother tells me humans are all vain and self-serving. 
mys: So far she hasn't been wrong.
boy-w: You say that like it's a bad thing.
boy: Meanwhile, look what I'm going through to rescue ^your brother! 
mys-c: ...
mys-h: Of course, the  ^ego thing you mentioned earlier. You must have a very big ego. 
boy-a: That's not what I meant!
boy: But yes, I do have a big ego. That's what makes me so good.

boy4-h: Yeah.
mys4: The witch is back!
boy4: So ... what of the prince?
ing4: She's not cooperating. But I don't blame her, she's in love. 
ing4: Never mind, we'll have to poison her.
boy4-w: Poison?
ing4: Yes. One sip of my blabbermouth potion and she'll tell us anything we want. 
ing4: Unfortunately, I used up most of my ingredients making my special concoction for you. 
boy4-s: Why do you seem so much more competent when you're causing grief for me? 
ing4-h: Because you're worth it, my love!
mys4: You're lucky to have love like this Boyle. In my land, people are not so forthcoming with their  emotions. 
boy4: I'm sorry Ingrid, I only have room in my heart for one creature, and it's Fang, not you. 
ing4: Don't worry, I've got a cure for that.
ing4-c: Or should I say ...
ing4-x: A curse!
ing4-x: Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
ing4: Once the potion is done, I can use these glass slippers to teleport back to my house and make it. 
boy4-w: You have teleporting slippers!?
boy4: Why don't we just go to the Shadow Lands ^now? 
ing4-a: Because they don't work like that!
ing4: They can only go to my house.
ing4: And as soon as I leave, I'll be sent to where I first used them. 
boy4-s: Oh ...
ing4: I can use them from our items menu at any time.
ing4-c: But I'm missing the secret ingredient - hot spice. 
ing4-c: I wonder if they sell it in Castle Town.
mys4: Nope.
ing4-c: How do you know?
mys4: I would have picked up on the scent. There's no hot spice in Castle Town. 
ing4: Well aren't you just a know-it-all.
ing4: I guess we'll have to harvest our own then.
ing4: I'll also need a mineral man to calm the potion.
ing4: Have you sniffed any of those?
mys4: Sorry, I don't know what that is.
ing4: Maybe somebody will sell us one.

mys2: I was rescued by a friend. I've decided to forgive you. 
mys2-h: And I'm still coming with you!
ing2-c: A mist wraith? How are you here? This should not be possible. 
mys2: This locket lets me go where I wish outside of the mist. I wish to be ^here. 
ing2: Why do you wish to be here, wraith?
mys2: It's him.
mys2: He confuses me. I thought I understood humans, but I was wrong.  
mys2: He is going on a great quest for a four-legs ... a creature not of his kind. 
mys2: I do not understand this, yet I want to. To understand, I must observe him. 
ing2-x: Ha!
ing2: He's a retired villain who failed at taking over the world once or twice, nothing more. 
ing2-a: And he's my future husband, not yours!
mys2: Yet, he is going to great length to save a fourlegs. 
boy2: Enough of this. Let me guess, you're going to follow me whether I want you to or not. 
boy2: If I say no  to you, you will plot until I say yes?
mys2-h: Yes.
ing2-h: Ha ha!
boy2: Ingrid, can't you turn her into something? Force her to go back? 
ing2: That would bring you joy. I enjoy watching you suffer. I vote for her to come with us. 
mys2: I vote for me to come with us.
boy2: Fine, you can come.
boy2-a: But don't get in my way and don't expect me to help you if you fall into a pit of venemous drake  snakes! 
mys2-c: Does this mean I should not help you if you fall into a pit of these venomous drake snakes?

mys3-c: What are you talking about? This is the most beautiful feeling I've ever felt. 
ing3: Remember, Boyle, only those with good intent can enter Aveyond. 
ing3: If we try to enter for unholy reasons, we will wish we hadn't. 
ing3: How can we be sure our quest is noble?
boy3: There's only one way.
ing3-w: What is wrong with him?
ing3-c: How can he be so sure ...

mys4-w: Boyle, we need to get you to a doctor!
boy4-a: Stop acting so strange.
boy4: Come on, we've got to look for the oars.
boy4-h: We'll have to keep looking, but I think they're close.

ing4: Proportionately, you might have.
ing4: Hang on a second, Boyle.

boy5: That girl is going to get herself eaten.
ing5: Would that be so bad?
boy5: You're the one who invited her along.
ing5: Yes, but she's rather annoying, don't you think?
boy5: I had to trap her in a cage to get rid of her the first time.

row2-x: Actually, my friends were the ones who broke the curse. 
7: I am very pleased! We owe you much, friends of Rowen. 
7: If there is anything you need of me, do not hesitate to ask. 
row2: We were hoping to ask you something. 
row2: We'd like to take the Rickety Biscuit.
7: That old thing? Whatever do you need it for?
row2: We need to get to the Shadow Isles to save a child from being sacrificed under the blood moon. 
7: Say no more. You know we have no interest in that kind of stuff here. 
7: We have no use for a ship. It is yours.
mys2-h: See Boyle, sometimes all you need to do is ask. 
boy2-w: I didn't hear any objections to my plan at the time! 
15: Now hold on one second, Queen Aenwyn!
row2-s: Miles ...
15: That ship is part of our history. We've no idea what secrets it could hold. 
7: If anybody's going to figure that out, it's Rowen.
15: You would have our history sail off into the sunset with some vagabond we may likely never see  again? 
row2-s: I'm sorry to ask such a thing, Miles. I only ask because of the blood - 
15: We don't care about any blood moons or prophecies.  
15: We keep to ourselves, we won't make the same mistakes as our ancestors. 
7: That's enough, Miles. We've turned our backs on the relics of the past. 
7: After what happened to our ancestors, it's best we keep as far away from them as possible. 
7: Rowen, you may take the ship, and you would be doing us a great service by doing so. 
15: She deserves nothing. She's not one of us anymore! 
boy2-w: This is getting awkward. Should we leave?
mys2-h: Why would we leave ^now?

hib5-w: Did I do something wrong?
hib5: Please, I mean no harm.
ing5: And yet everywhere you go, people want to hurt you. 
hib5-w: Yikes! $w.30 I think I need to read up on socializing a bit more. 
row: Let's speak to the Lady Aenwyn. I should be able to convince her to give up the ship pretty easily. 
hib: Before we go, could I have a quick word with you about something Rowen? 
ing: There'll be time for talking later. You shouldn't have overslept. 

Event 19: Visit Ron about BOY
20: What are you doing here?
row2-s: I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused. I really wanted to avoid all of this. 
20: Of course you did, you avoid everything.
row3-s: Please Miles ...
row3-s: Can I see him?
20: Why? So you can leave again?
20: Are you really that selfish that you would do that to him? 
row3-a: I wasn't going to come in, but he's having nightmares. 
20: Only because he went snooping around in those vaults! I told you we never should have gone in there. 
row3: He's been corrupted. Hi'beru can heal him, but only if you let us. 
20: I'm the one who's supposed to protect him! I'm the one who stayed! 
row3-s: You do protect him. But this is my fault, let me fix it. 
20: Fine.
20: But I want you to leave as soon as you're done.
row3-s: ...
row3: Hey there buddy.
18: Who are you?
row3: I'm ...
row3: I'm just ... an adventurer.
18: Really? My mom is an adventurer too! Have you met her? 
row3: I ... could have. What does she look like?
18: My dad says she was the most beautiful elf in Delamere. 
18: She is busy saving the world all the time, so she never gets to come home. 
18: I'm going to be an adventurer when I get big too. 
18: Then I'm going to find my mom and help her save the world! 
18: Why are you crying? Are you sad?
row3-s: Oh ... it's nothing.
row3: Listen, if you want to be an adventurer, you have to be brave. 
18: I'm brave.
row3: You have to be ready at a moment's notice. 
row3: The call to adventure always comes when you least expect it. 
18: I'm always ready!
row3-x: Well then, would you like to go an adventure with me right now? 
18: Really!?
row3: I'm going somewhere very scary and I need somebody brave to come along and keep me safe. 
18: I go on scary adventures all the time, but only when I'm asleep ... 
row3: Sometimes those are the most dangerous adventures of all. 
row3-h: Come on, let's go.
20: Wait a minute, Rowen.
20: I need to know why you did it.
row2-c: Did what?
20: That curse wasn't intended for you, but you just happened to get in the way at the last second. 
20: I never understood why you did it.
row3-s: I had to leave anyway. There's too much out there in the world to see. 
row3: My call to adventure came sooner than I had hoped, but I had to take it. 
row3: If it meant I could save somebody else from a life of slavery at the same time, all the better. 
20: Did you even think about me?
row3-a: Of course I did!
row3-s: All those days we spent exploring the vaults. I thought we'd live a life of adventure together. 
row3-s: But after the wedding everything changed, you changed.  
row3-s: I thought I could change too, but I couldn't.
row3-s: I didn't want this life. I thought we'd explore the world just like we did the vaults. 
20: The vaults ... I always hated that place.
row3-s: Then why did you explore them with me? 
20: Why do you think?
row3-s: I'm sorry it turned out like this.

row: I've read that it was quite a sight to behold back in the day. 
row: The people here reject the stories of our ancestors. 
row: We have a saying: there is no future in the ways of the past. 
row-x: I think it's nonsense ...

row-c: Hi'beru? What are you doing here?
hib: I'm also a reader of people.
row-a: What are you talking about?
hib-a: He is troubled, Rowen. Nightmares haunt him.
hib-a: If I don't see him, the corruption will not let go. He will suffer forever. 
row-s: I have no place in that house anymore.
hib-s: I too left my home to seek greater fulfilment.
hib-a: Regardless, we must help him. It's the least we can do. 

Event 50: EV050

boy-w: What is it?
Elizabeth: I've recovered!
Elizabeth: Which means it's time for our duel!
boy: That's right, I was finally going to show you how powerful I am. 
boy: Right before you disappeared.
boy: Well, there will be no escape for you this time.
boy: And ^don't expect me to go easy on you!
Elizabeth: I'll do you the favor of cutting of your tongue before it gets you into more trouble.

hib-x: It never hurts to check.
rob: He's doing the eye thing again.
ing-a: Hi'beru, cut it out!
hib-x: Ouch! Sorry ...
ing-a: Stop doing it then!
hib-x: I thought I sensed something!
ing-a: You're about to feel something else, and you're not going to like it! 
hib-w: Fine, I'm done.
hib: It's quite late. We should find somewhere to rest and get an early start in the morning. 
rob: Hey, we could stay with Rowen's family.
rob-h: Then she could catch up with them and we would have somewhere to stay for free! 
row-a: No!
rob-c: ...
ing: Robin, there are six of us. Do you think her familyhas space for us? 
rob: I always used to host groups of crusaders at my nan's house. It was an honor to give back to  those guys.

49: He won't mind! 
row4: Don't worry, your time will come.
49: Okay ...
49: But if you ever see my mom, can you tell her where I live? 
49: Maybe if she's not busy she could come say hi.
row4: Of course. I have a feeling she'll come to visit you real soon. 
row4: You should get to bed now.
49: Bye. Thanks again.
row: Thanks for everything, Hi'beru. I'll pay you myself for this one. 
hib: Keep your money.
hib-h: I'm still just a beginner, after all.
row-x: I wanted to ask you ...
row: You said your decision to travel was not common for your people. 
row-c: So why did you do it?
hib: There's too much I don't know.
hib: And I'm not going to find it at home.
row: It's comforting to meet somebody else like me.

mys2-c: Conspiring with demons, perhaps?
hib2: I don't know, I think Miles may just be troubled right now ... 
ing2-a: If you start with your dream reading nonsense again we're taking you back to the  shrimps. 
hib2-w: I'll be quiet.
row2-s: I'm sure he's not up to anything, he's just being disagreeable. 
rob2-w: Ingrid! Watch out!
ing2: Oh, there you are.
ing2: Do you have the key?
boy2: Of course I have it.
ing2-h: I like you better as a snake.

boy: Come with me.
boy: I'll never let anything happen to you.
boy: I promise.
hib2: So this is what's been haunting you.
boy-s: I never broke my promise to Fang.
hib-x: Until recently.
hib-x: Bahl saw his chance, and corrupted you.
hib-x: But we can bring it to an end right now.
hib-x: It won't be easy, but we'll have to fight him.
boy-w: Fight him!?
boy: Can't you just defeat him?
hib-x: I can only wake him up.
hib-x: If you want the nightmares to end, you have to defeat him at his own game. 
hib-x: I'll do my best to help.
hib-x: And I'm sure Fang would be glad to help you.
boy-h: Let's do it!

Event 8: EV008
boy-a: The wicked wolf!
boy-a: You've taken enough lives!

Event 2: EV002
boy: Fang! What are you doing back here?
boy-s: Fang? 
boy-s: Fang, please forgive me.

Event 13: EV013
boy-a: Time to die!
4: Very well, Boyle.
4: You have won, but you only defeated my phantom.
4: When we meet for real, I won't be so easily defeated. 
boy-a: I look forward to destroying the real you.
hib-x: We've done it.
hib-x: How do you feel?
boy-c: Hmmm ...
boy-s: Normal.
hib-x: Perfect!
hib-x: Open your eyes, I'm going to wake you up now.

boy: You bet I- $end
boy-c: What is it, Fang?
boy-c: What's that?
boy-c: You want that collar?
boy: ...
boy: Fine ... give me the collar.
ing3-a: Boyle ^Wolfbane!
boy-w: Uh oh!
ing: You been hiding from me, Boyle?
boy-a: ^Hiding? $w.30 Why would I be hiding? I'm the most powerful one here! 
ing: Maybe at one time, but now you're just as weak as the rest of us retired villains. 
ing: Where is the mir wood? You were supposed to collect it. 
boy-w: Oh, the mir wood? I can explain ...
ing-s: Why did I ever curse you to marry me? In half a year we'll be stuck together forever. 
boy-s: Come on, Ingrid! Do you have any idea how difficult it is to collect mir wood? 
ing-x: No, I don't. Because we always send you. Ha ha ha ha ha. 
ing: It should be no problem for somebody as skilled as yourself. 
ing: You always like to let us all know how successful you ^almost were. 
ing: I'll meet you back here when you're done.
boy: Come on Fang, looks like it's up to us once again. 

Event 7: U.Fang
boy: Those quail eggs are doing wonders for your coat, Fang. 
boy-h: You get cuter as you get older.
boy-h: If you bite that witch, I'll give you double dinner tonight. 
boy: Fine, suit yourself. You just like the way she scratches you with those nails. 

Event 25: EV025
23: Wicked residents of Wyrmwood! We've come to end your wickedness once and for all! 
20: Leave us alone, we're retired.

20: Fine, come on girls.
18: A purple frog? $w.30 Somebody's in a cheeky mood today!

20: Poor Ingrid.

Event 95: U.pumpers
boy: It's a pumpkin.

Event 2: S.Ophelia
this: Get away from me, Boyle! I know what you're up to! I've been cultivating this pumpkin garden for an  entire year! 
boy: What am I going to do to it?
this: You can't hide the amber glow in your eyes, Boyle! 
this: You and that Sid Riddle are always scheming! I can tell when you've got pumpkin on the brain. 
this: I adore every single pumpkin in this garden!

Event 13: S.Hadir
this: Oh my, Fang is looking beautiful! What have you been feeding him? 
boy: Prize tickets, mostly.
this: What? Seriously? He really eats that?
boy: Yeah, go ahead. Give it a try.
this: $s.1 ... okay. $s.3
this: $s.1 ADORABLE. $s.3
this: But ... he's not eating it.
boy: He might later.
this: Did Fang eat those tickets yet?
boy: Not yet. He just ate.

Event 11: U.Ticket
boy: Well, well, what have we here? Looks like  somebody dropped their tickets! 
boy: They look a bit slimey. Can you grab them Fang?

Event 28: U.Shed House
boy: It seems everybody is attending the party.

Event 71: U
boy-c: I have a haunch I'd regret wasting my tickets on this. 

Event 122: S.Franz Croswell
this: Once I get enough tickets, I'm all over that covey balm. 
this: Or, rather, it's all over me.

Event 19: S.Priscilla
this: Would you like to be transformed too?

Event 18: S.Arabella
this: Poor Ingrid, she tries so hard but she just can't get her head around transformations. 
boy: Good. She's enough of a menace already.

Event 109: U.Ticket
boy: Well, well, well, what have we here? Looks like somebody dropped their tickets! 
boy: They look a bit slimey. Can you grab them Fang?

Event 12: S.Sid Riddle
this: I'm close ... oh, I'm so close.
boy: Are you still obsessing over that thing, Sid?
this: Tonight is different, Boyle. Never have I been closer to figuring out its secrets! 
boy: Any new ideas?
this: It bears a resemblance to some of the pumpkins here in Wyrmwood. 
this: They could very well hold the key to this puzzle. Maybe literally. 
this: But their shells are almost as hard to crack as the riddle of the giant pumpkin. 
this: Help me get inside and I promise to share the splendor of whatever it is that lurks inside. 
boy: I suppose I could dismantle a few pumpkins.
this: I'm close ... oh, I'm so close.

Event 81: U.pumpers
boy: It's a pumpkin.

Event 37: EV037
boy: I can't leave, I'm collecting tickets.
boy-c: What's going on here? That mist ... where did it come from? 
ing4: It came down from the Mist Mountains.
34: What is that!?
boy-w: Fang!
35: I wouldn't go in there if I were you!
35: Few have ever returned from the Mist Mountains. 
boy-a: None have ever ^entered  the Mist Mountains.
35: Which is why they're still with us.
boy: I don't care what happens. That's my dog. I'm going after him. 
ing4-w: Boyle, ^wait!
boy: Don't worry about me, Ingrid. I'll be fine.
ing4-a: The mir wood, Boyle! Give it to me.
boy-w: Oh ... right.
1: Should we try to stop him? It's surely dangerous up in those mountains. 
ing4: He'll be fine.
35: Fang entered the Mist Mountains and he hasn't returned! 
ing4-a: He's been gone for ^one minute.
35: Ravens perceive time differently to humans ...
ing4-h: Enough of this. Who's up for some mir-roasted marshmallows? 
35: ...
ing4-a: What now? 
35: Ravens perceive marshmallows differently to humans. 

Event 73: EV073
19: You take another step, Boyle Wolfbane, and I'll turn you into a toadfish! 
boy-w: I wasn't going to go in! I swear!
boy-w: Just inspecting the gingerwork!

Event 105: S.Vanesssa
this: My grumpy husband never comes out of the crypt for these events. 

Event 85: EV085
89: The Raven Lord's not going to be happy about that. 
89: Ingrid was supposed to put those things ^away.
89: Right, Boyle, time to collect the critters.
boy: I'm busy.
89: Help me round them up and I'll give you my tickets.
89: Come on, they're hanging out near the fireworks.
89: I'll be waiting.

Event 9: EV009
10: Oh, hey Boyle! You wanna play apple bobbing?
boy: No, Payne, $w.20 ^I $w.20 still have my self-respect ... even if everybody else here has  lost theirs. 
10: You can win some tickets.
boy-h: I can win tickets?
10: You can buy yourself another one of those fancy gargoyles if you win enough. 
boy-c: Hmmm ...
boy: I mean, gargoyles ^are rather $n sinister ...
boy: And if I only bob as a means of obtaining the gargoyle, I'm not really compromising my integrity ... in  a way. 

Event 91: Elzabeth2
this: Good work, Boyle.
this: A smashing good time.

Event 33: EV033
boy: Ingrid is probably in that direction.

Event 29: U.Raven
103: Hello, Boyle.
boy-a: Why do you have so many birds?!
103: I'm the Raven Lord ...
boy: Got any tickets?

boy: Fine, I'll leave you be.
boy-a: How many birds do you have in there!?
103: $w.60 Enough.

Event 97: U.pumpers

Event 108: EV108
110: What's going on out here?
boy: Not much.
boy: Are you collecting tickets?
110: No ... this isn't my kind of party.

boy: I don't use mana.

Event 72: U

Event 80: U.pumpers
boy: It's a pumpkin.

Event 43: EV043
Hughbert2: We're doomed!
61: The mist has swallowed my house!
42: I'm wanted on three continents. I have nowhere else to go! 
ing5: Calm down everyone.
60: Look!
60: Boyle's returned from the mist!
40: He's alive!
boy: I come bearing news. Someone stole the Mist Queen's youngest son. 
41: Oh ...
41: Is she mad?
boy: Well, she covered the town in mist.
41: So ...
boy: She threatened to cover the whole world in mist if her son isn't found soon. 
boy-a: And even worse, Fang is still lost in the mist. 
boy-s: Unless we can find her son, he could die in there. 
boy-c: Oh, and us too.
Hughbert2: Are you suggesting that ^one ^of ^us does the work of a hero? 
sys: Sounds of horror and dismay ripple through the crowd. 
boy: If we're to save Fang and the village, we'll need to go to Aveyond and ask for help from the Oracle. 
41: Oh, dear! Poor Arabella has fainted!
boy: Come on, we're ^retired!
boy: Be honest, who else apart from me has done anything worthy of incurring her wrath? 
boy: So who's going to go?
Elzabeth8: A knight cut off my toe! I'd never survive the journey. 
Raven Lord8: The impenetrable mist ... it's kind of pretty!  
Raven Lord8: I'm sure we'll manage living with it ... somehow. 
61: I left a potion on the stove! If I don't get back to it soon, it might turn into chicken stew. 
boy-w: How can you all be afraid of a frail old woman? 
boy: Fine, I guess I'll have to do it myself, just like everything else around here. 
42: That's mighty brave of you, Boyle!
60: We support you one thousand percent, Boyle.
boy-a: And you call yourselves villains!
Hughbert9: Actually, we're retired.
ing5: I'll come with you, Boyle.
boy: No way! You've done enough to me already.
ing5-a: Fine! But don't go thinking you'll find some pixie in Aveyond who will remove your curse! 
ing5-a: We're getting married, whether you like it or ^not! 
boy: I'll save you Fang, even if it means going to Aveyond ^myself! 

Event 4: EV004
boy: I'm not scared of her, I just don't feel like talking to her right now. 

Event 74: U.pumpers
boy: It's a pumpkin.

Event 31: EV031
boy: She'd never look for us in her own house!
Fang: ...
boy: You think it's a bad idea? Fine.

Event 5: 
boy2: Look at these fools, Fang.
boy2: Can you believe they're actually throwing themselves a blood moon party to celebrate their  villainy? 
boy2-a: What did any of ^them ever accomplish?
boy2: They're all failures.
boy2-s: You and I don't deserve to be grouped in with the rest of them. 
z-ing2-a: Boyle Wolfbane!
boy2-w: Uh oh!
ing2: Boyle Wolfbane! Where are you hiding?
ing2-a: If you're in there and you don't open up, I'm going to knock your house down! 
ing2: Unless the wind beats me to it!
ing2-x: Ha ha ha ha!
boy2: Don't worry Fang, she doesn't know any spells. 
boy2-w: Fang, she must have heard you!
boy2-a: If she knocks over my gargoyle, we're going to have a problem. 

Event 16: S.Laguna Le Rouge
this: Guess which bucket contains a ticket and they can all be yours! 
this: Choose incorrectly ... and you must surrender  all your tickets to me. 
boy-c: That seems a bit unfair.
this: Yeah, I suppose. But you see, there's this gargoyle statue ... 
boy: I've heard enough. You're on.
this: Good. Choose wisely. But please don't.
boy: Fang, where are the tickets?
boy: What is it, Fang?
boy-h: Well, well ... what have we here?
boy: Good job, Fang. I never would have guessed he had them tucked away ^behind ^his ^caravan. 
this: $w.25 $s.1 Ah $w.25 heh $w.25 heh ... $s.3
this: Please, Boyle! I'm sorry. Don't take my tickets.
boy: Sorry, but there's this gargoyle ...
this: I guess I'll never own that gargoyle now.

Event 30: U.Vamps
boy: Vampires, always brooding.

Event 47: EV047
boy: I'm not leaving until i get that gargoyle.

Event 10: S.Payne
this: Care for some apple bobbing?
boy: Let's get this over with. What do I have to do?
this: Just grab an apple out of the tank with your  mouth. If you find the green one, you'll win some  tickets! 
boy-c: That's all I have to do? Are you serious?
this: I'm surprised, I would have thought you'd consider yourself above sticking your head in water. 
boy-h: Oh, but I do.
boy-h: Fang.
boy: Good job Fang, you can eat it if you want.
this: Oh, that's actually the only $end
boy: What were you saying?
this: Never mind ...
this: Here you go.
this: I guess the fun's over now.

Event 26: T.Ingrid's House
boy: She'd never look for me in her own house!
boy-c: Or maybe she would.

Event 96: U.pumpers
boy: It's a pumpkin.

Event 69: U
boy: It will be mine.

Event 119: EV119
91: Time to send them back to the depths.

6: What in the world!? You've killed my demon!!!
6: Do you know how long it took to craft that thing!?
6: My girls spent ^weeks creating that!
phy-w: I had no idea!
phy-w: Please forgive me!
phy-s: It's just ... I swore to vanquish ^every demon that ever lived. 
6: Well you don't have to vanquish the harmless ones. 
6: Ingrid, did you put him up to this?
@a: Take Phye's side
@b: Take Jinx's side
ing-h: And so what if I did?
ing-a: That thing was every bit as despicable as the rest of your crafts. 
ing: It ^needed to be destroyed.
6: I should have known you'd never let me have ^anything nice! 
6: If you're in the guild - Oh, by the way, I have a new guild spell to teach you. 
6: Of course not

Event 3: EV003
ing: All right, you guys can wait outside if you like.
boy: Thank you!
rob: I'm not afraid of any witches. I'll come in and make sure you're okay, like last time. 
ing: I'd rather you stay outside. She can be quite crafty, and you look far too innocent. 
rob-a: I can be mean!
ing: Your mean face is almost cuter than your neutral face. You're out. 
hib: I have no objections. I've gotten myself into quite enough trouble already.

18: There are ... so many. 
18: I don't understand, this was supposed to be a surprise attack. 
25: There must be a traitor among us!
18: Never mind! All they've done is made it easier for us to find the demons! 
19: This ... isn't really what I was expecting.
27: Yes, it's rather quite miserable here, isn't it?
24: Come to think of it, the demons never really bothered me in the first place. 
19: Let's return to the boat and hightail it out of here!
27: Here here!
18: ^Cowards! $w.20 Dare thee skulk from thy quest? 
18: These demons would see our land destroyed!
18: They think we are too weak to stand up to them!
18: But we are paladins, and we will fight until the end, no matter the cost! 
18: Today we show them that though they may take our lives ... 
18: They will ^never take our pride!

boy: Pesky do-gooders. They attack our village every few days. 
mys2-c: So we can't get across?
x-boy: See that switch over there? They would have cranked that as they left to retract the bridge. 
x-mys2: So what do we do?
boy-h: I've got an idea but you're probably not going to like it. 
mys2-c: Why wouldn't I $end

mys-h: Sorry.
mys: So will you be fighting the troll now?

me: Please bring them to me in the Windshire magic store. 
boy: Forget it!
mys: You're not going to do that?
boy: That's the work of a hero.
mys: We'll probably get a reward though!
boy: You mean I stand to be rewarded for doing something I was already going to do? 
boy-h: That ^almost makes it evil!
mys-h: And we can share the reward!
boy: I'll share it with Fang.
boy: No more jobs.

vn-mys-w: Head back? But I'm coming ^with you!
vn-boy: You've come far enough.
vn-mys: I'm coming with you until the very end, whether you like it or not! 
vn-boy-c: Until the end, you say ...
vn-boy: Well in that case, we'll have to make a detour first. 
vn-boy: The people in Windshire aren't very welcoming of new people. 
vn-boy: We'll have to steal something from the goblins and present it to them to earn their trust. 
x-boy-c: I know of one such thing ...
x-boy: It rests deep in this cave ... but we'll have to get there first.

mys-c: Why are you lying on the floor, strange man?
ing: That's a good question.
boy: It must be a dream healing technique. Shall I lie down too? 
hib2: No, that won't be necessary at the moment.
hib2: Do you remember the terms of our agreement, Boyle? I wished only for the chance to cure you. 
boy: Of course I remember that.
hib2: Great, so I do hope you'll give me that chance by setting me free. 
boy-c: Setting you free?
hib2: Yes. You can't see them, but I am in fact being detained by a group of fine tiny men. 
hib2-w: Ouch!
hib2: And ladies! Of course! Forgive my crass implications. 
hib2-w: Ouch!
boy: How did you end up in this predicament?
hib2: I promise I'll explain later, but at the moment I answer directly to the little men ... and women! 
hib2-w: Ouch!
hib2: I mean ^women and men!
boy: I promise he wasn't this pathetic in my dream.
ing: This guy's about as credible as those paladins.
rob: I believe you, Hi'beru.
rob-a: People didn't used to think I was a paladin either! 
ing: We're still not convinced of that ourselves.
hib2: They've agreed to free me ...
hib2: ... under the condition that I pay them compensation for the the hurt my flilppant attitude has  caused. 
ing: He's clearly lost his mind.
boy: And if I pay this debt of yours, you will cure me?
hib2: Admittedly, I am still fairly new at this. In fact, this is my first expedition away from my homeland. 
hib2: But I see no reason why I shouldn't be able to cure you. My professor said I was one of his favorite  students! 
boy: So you mean you've never even done this before? 
hib2: Well, my plan was to start small ...
hib2-w: Ouch!
hib2: Figuratively speaking!
hib2: But it appears even tiny people are capable of big dreams. $w.45 And grandiose delusions. $w.10 
hib2-w: Ouch ouch ouch!!!
hib2: I should stop speaking.
boy: So you found me in a moment of weakness and saw your ticket to freedom. 
hib2: ...
boy: I'm impressed. You seem like a resouceful man, so I believe in you. What do the tiny people want? 
hib2: Furniture ... ouch! Tiny furniture!
mys-h: They want ^tiny ^furniture? That's so funny!
hib2-w: Ouch! Please, I'm being pinched for your transgressions. 
mys: We can't even see these people. How could somebody make furniture that small? 
hib2: They say there is a man who can do it. To find him, you will need to go to the end of the world. 
boy: Tell them we'll do it. Just tell us what they want.
hib2: It's not a metaphor, you literally have to go to the end of the world. 
hib2: It's on the continent to the west of here.
boy: How do we find the ends of the world?
hib2: ...
hib2: They're not sure.
hib2: You'll have to find the way there yourself.
hib2-w: Ouch!
hib2: Please, make haste! They've started biting!
boy: Maybe somebody in Tor can tell us. That's where most rumors are born. 

Event 18: U
boy: It's just a seed.
boy: Alright, I'll just pour this here ...


Map 164: Dream Realm #4
----------------------------------------

Event 1: EV001
boy2-w: Here again?
boy2: Do you mind explaining exactly what this place is. 
hib2: This is the dream realm.
hib2: People have a tendency to believe their dreams are disconnected from reality. 
hib2: But in fact, they all occur in a persistent realm known as the dream world. 
boy2: What? Why have I never heard of this place before? 
hib2: The dream plains are a sacred place, with access granted to only the most enlightened  individuals.  
hib2-h: Incidentally, they're also a great place to find clients! 
hib2: People usually only encounter this particular part of the dream realm when they've been infected. 
hib2: Animals are more in touch with nature. You've probably seen a few of those around here. 
boy2: Does that mean all the animals I've been fighting in here ... are real animals? 
hib2: Yes.
hib2: But don't worry, you were just waking them up.
hib2: You can't actually hurt yourself in the dream realm. 
boy2: Great, so who do we fight?
hib2: I'm afraid it's not that simple.
hib2: All dreams stem from ideas and beliefs.
hib2: Sometimes these ideas can run away with themselves, allowing corruption to set in. 
hib2: We'll need to delve into your consciousness to find the source of the corruption. 
boy2: And then what?
hib2: We kill it.
boy2: I  knew it!
hib2: We'll need to see if we can find the place where your nightmare occurs. 
hib2: Once we're there, we'll have to see it through to completion without waking up. 

Event 6: EV006
4: What's this place?
hib2: This is the dream realm. We need to find the corruption before we can fight it. 
4: Like a treasure hunt!
hib2: Yes.

4: It doesn't matter, he can't defeat you by himself!
1: He's right, you're nothing without your friends.
boy2-w: My ^friends?
boy2: Who needs friends ...
boy2-h: When you've got minions!
sys: Minions appear.
4: What is the meaning of this? Why is he not dead?
1: I was probably too powerful for the gemstone ... it must have actually made me ^less powerful. 
sys: Myst turns into a wolf to counter the stone and releases her brother. 
1: Nooo!!
1: What have you villains done!? 
4: Don't stand in that circle!!!
sys: Hercules gets hit by lightning and they merge into one creature.

boy2: If he resists the brainwashing, we'll have to resort to more drastic measures. But let's hope it  doesn't come to that. 
rob2: Oh ... hi guys! Are you the ones who kidnapped me? 
boy2: Silence! We require your powers for our own purposes. Do as we say and no harm  will come to  you! 
mys2-a: You said we weren't going to force anything on him! 
boy2-s: Oh, right. Sorry.
rob2-h: Sounds like fun! What are we doing?
ing2-c: He seems a little too ^enthused, doesn't he?
boy2-c: Yes ...
boy2: Do you understand you were shoved in a bag and brought into a strange place? 
rob2-c: I've always thought of her as more eclectic than strange. 
boy2-c: ... come again?
rob2-h: This is my nan's house! I've been minding itwhile she's on holiday. 
mys2: This one is not like the others. He is just a boy.
rob2-w: No, no! I'm a paladin! I swear!
boy2: It doesn't matter, all paladins are the same.
rob2-w: He's right! We're all the same! And we have the same powers!  
rob2: There's absolutely no point in kidnapping somebody else. 
boy2: So you can do ^anything a normal paladin could do? 
rob2-h: Absolutely!
boy2: Fine, you'll do. Although I find your acceptance disturbing. 
rob2: Since we're going to be working together from now on, I think we should introduce ourselves. 
rob2: I'm Robin ... ummm, I'm a paladin. But you already knew that. That's why you kidnapped me  after all. 
rob2-h: A fantastic choice you will ^not regret, by the way! 
rob2: So who's going next?
boy2-a: ...
ing2: I'm not good at introductions. I'm more of a ^goodbye kind of person. 
rob2: That's funny, I'm the opposite of that!
ing2: Fine, may as well get this over with.
ing2: My name is Ingrid. This is my future husband, Boyle. 
ing2: We're on a quest to save the world and find a perfect wedding venue. 
rob2-h: That's amazing! So what was the proposal? Ring hidden in food?  
ing2-h: Curse.
rob2-c: Hmmm ... I've never heard of that before, but it sounds cool. 
ing2-h: Trust me, it was a very ^enchanting proposal!
ing2-x: Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
rob2: I would have gone for ring hidden in food myself. 
rob2: It must be great going on such  an adventure with somebody you love. 
boy2: Actually, she's insufferable.
rob2: So what about you, snow hair girl?
mys2-c: ...
rob2: Nice to meet you, ummm ... I didn't catch yourname. 
mys2: Myst.
rob2-c: Miss ...
mys2: Myst. With a T.
rob2-h: Of course! Miss Myst!
mys2: You are not like other men.
rob2-s: So I've been told ...
mys2: Your predisposition to anger is not immediately apparent. 
rob2-c: Well I haven't been told ^that before.
boy2: That's enough introductions. Robin, accompany us to the princess's chambers. 
rob2-h: You mean I get to see inside the castle!?
rob2: New friends, a new adventure ... this is fast turning into the best day ever! 
rob2-w: Not that this sort of thing doesn't happen all the time! You know, since I'm a paladin ... 
boy2-a: I'm not your friend. Our relationship is one of minion and master $w.30 ^at ^best! 
rob2-h: Of course!

boy: Any idea what this is?
this: This isn't good!
this: The kobolds are trying to summon a bone dragon!

boy: You were right, they were trying to summon a bone dragon. 
this: I knew it. Did you put a stop to them?
boy: Of course.
this: Good work.

this: Yes, but just who could he be?
this: ...
this: Let's put that dungeon of yours to some use.

boy: All of your enemies are locked up.
this: Thanks. I knew I could count on you.
boy: Do you feel confident the kobolds will leave you alone now? 
this: It's a wait-and-see kind of thing.
this: The most important thing was having my enemies behind bars. 
this: It feels good having them in a dungeon.

this: Hey Leopold!
Leopold: What?
this: Stand down.
Leopold: Okay.

boy-a: Prettier than Wolfy- I mean Fang? Such a creature does not exist. 
boy: No, you're right ... I'll find you something better.
boy: How about a beautiful ^white wolfy?
mys-a: Boyle!
this: I want an exotic pet! Not some mutt from the Tor managerie! 
boy: Sure.
this: I want an exotic pet from another continent!
boy: Just wait here. I'll bring you something.
boy: It's time to commandeer that ship.
boy: Just wait here. I'll bring you something.
this: I'm getting bored of Wolfy!

this: Better than transformation magic? I doubt it.
this: Are you ready to contribute to the coven?
ing: You mean contribute to ^you, right?

ing4: You're up to something again, aren't you?

boy-w: What about ^D ^- ^None ^of ^the ^above?
this: Right now I have a more important task for you.
this: One of my members has reported in in a while.
this: She's supposed to be in Tor. Find her and ask why she hasn't reported in. 
ing-s: That's boring.
this: I'll teach you the spell I was going to teach ^her.
ing-x: That's more like it!
this: Find the rogue coven member and ask why she hasn't reported in. 
this: She should be in Tor.
ing: We found your missing member.
ing: She tried to fly, but we caught her and she clucked. 
this: She was trying to leave the guild?

ing: Here's the chicken feed.
this: Very good, this will be sure to lure the chickens back to my place.

this: Then return to me.
this: There are three lumberjacks in Evanwall forest that I've had my eye on. 
this: Transform them into chickens and send them back here. 
this: Well that was a waste of time.
this: I'll have to think of a new plan.

this: If you find somebody fascinated with witchcraft, they shouldn't be too hard to convince. 
this: I'll have to think of a new plan.
this: While I do that, you should recruit a new member for the coven. 
this: If you find somebody fascinated with witchcraft, they shouldn't be too hard to convince. 
this: Good, you recruited a new member.
this: I'll teach you a transformation.
sys: Ingrid learns transofrmation.
this: That spell will transform your target into their true animal form, whatever it may be. 
this: It differs for each person.
this: I've finished thinking up my new plan.
this: I could never marry a lumberjack, I need somebody of a higher standing. 
this: A paladin!
ing-x: A ^paladin, you say?
rob-w: Ingrid, why are you looking at me like that?
this: He's just a baby. I want a distinguished paladin.

this: Bring me a distinguished paladin.
this: Another waste of my time!
this: I don't know what it is, but something about these men just isn't working for me. 
this: There's only one thing left to do.
this: I'm going to have to use my mirror of insight.
this: Perhaps you'll remember it. It's the one you broke when we were children. 
ing-a: You broke my vampire doll first!
this: I don't care what happened all those years ago.
this: You're going to have to repair the mirror.
this: It needs to be re-tempered in the demon flames on the Shadow Isles. 
ing-w: The demon land!?
this: Dangerous, I know.
this: But I was going to teach you the ultimate transformation. 
this: It's a self transformation, and will give you incredible power. 
ing-x: The ^ultimate ^transformation?
ing: Give me the mirror.
this: You're going to have to repair the mirror.
this: It needs to be re-tempered in the demon flames on the Shadow Isles. 
ing4: Here is your tempered mirror.
this: Give it to me!
this: Hmmm ...
this: It's showing me with a crown.
this: This explains it.
this: I can only settle for royalty.
this: That must be why I was attracted to the prince.
ing4: We can kidnap the jester for you.
this: No! If I can't have the prince, I want somebody of a ^higher standing! 
boy4-a: There isn't anybody! The prince would only be  outranked by the ^king! 
ing4-x: $s.1 I think we may have our solution.
this: If I can't have the prince, I want somebody of a ^higher standing! 
this: The mirror didn't lie. I've never known such happiness. 
this: Would you like to join my coven?
ing: I can't, I've already joined a different one.

Event 17: EV017
10: Good work, Ingrid.
ing4-a: I can't believe you did that to me!
10: It was necessary. Now you can learn the spell.
10: Ingrid learned chicken transformation.
ing4-a: Consider yourself lucky that I crave new transformations so ... 
boy4: Go eat some worms.
ing4-x: Ah ha ha ha ha ha!
ing4-a: Don't worry, I saved some for you.
this: Ingrid force-feeds Boyle worms.
ing4-x: Ah ha ha ha ha ha!
mys4-c: He seems to be enjoying them.
ing4-w: Yes, we should stop.

Event 9: EV009
ing3: Grunhilda!
Grunhilda2: What do you want now, Ingrid?
ing3: I've brought Boyle to have a cup of tea with you. He wants to get to know you before the  wedding day. 
ing3-a: Isn't that right, Boyle?
boy3-c: Errr, yes. 
boy3: I suppose I should build up a tolerance to that hideous face now so I'm not surprised on the  wedding day. 
Grunhilda2: Oh, isn't that nice!
Grunhilda2: Sit, sit.
ing3: Here's your tea! Drink up!
boy3: Ingrid, are you sure ^this is the tea I'm supposed to drink? 
ing3: Yes, I promise.
Grunhilda2: Let's switch.
Grunhilda2: Now drink up before I curse you.
boy3-w: Ingrid?
ing3: I suggest you do what she says. Unless you feel like having a really, ^really long nap. 
boy3-w: Heh ...
mys3-c: Ingrid, you seem quite calm. Did you anticipate this? 
ing3: No. But it doesn't matter because I poisoned them both. 
boy3-a: You did ^what!?
ing3: If you think about it, it actually makes the ^most sense. 
ing3-h: Go ahead, Myst, ask him whatever you want.
mys3-h: Cool! $w.30 Hey Boyle, what is your biggest fear? 
boy3-s: Paladins ...
ing3-x: ^Paladins? Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
ing3-h: Hey Boyle, what ^really happened to the tea cozy that disappeared from my fireplace? 
boy3-s: I stole it. I cherish it deeply and it looks much better on my nightstand anyway. 
ing3-h: I ^knew it!
mys3-h: Hey, I've got one!
mys3-c: Boyle, are you ^really not in love with Ingrid?
boy3-s: Well, actually -
ing3-w: ^NO!
mys3-c: What did you do that for?
ing3-s: Heh ...
ing3: I thought I'd save him the embarrassment. You know ... 
ing3: Besides, we're supposed to be getting information from Grunhilda. 
ing3: Grunhilda, where is the prince?
Grunhilda2: I turned him into a frog. He's frollicking around in the swamp somewhere. 
ing3-h: And who's the most beautiful witch you've ever seen? 
Grunhilda2: You are, Ingrid.
ing3-x: Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
ing3-h: Do you desire my looks? Do you curse mother for spawning a child so ugly as yourself? 
Grunhilda2: Every day.
ing3-h: Ha ha! This is great!
mys3-h: Hey Grunhilda, what is the most ^embarrassing thing Ingrid has ever done? 
Grunhilda2: One day when we were children $end
ing3-a: !!!
mys3-s: Sorry ...
ing3: Play time is over. Come on Boyle.
boy3-a: I can't believe you tricked me like that!
ing3: Oh calm down, did you want to save the princess or not? 
ing3: Besides, that tea cozy cost me a lot of gold.
ing3: In case you missed it, the prince is frolicking around in the swamp as a frog. 

Event 2: EV002
Grunhilda: Well if it isn't my ^beautiful sister, Ingrid!
ing2: Grunhilda! Look at you, as unsightly as the day you were born! It's been too long. 
Grunhilda: Unsightly as I may be, ^I'm going to marry a prince. 
Grunhilda: You don't seem very surprised.
ing2: A cursed princess and a missing prince. I don't think I'll be running to the Mystic to answer that one. 
Grunhilda: Regardless, I'll be a lot better off than you! Where is ^your husband? 
ing2: I'm going to marry Boyle the Horrible.
Grunhilda: Hmmm ... not much of a catch.
ing2: Actually, he was ^very difficult to catch.
ing2: At least, when I was trying to apply the curse.
Grunhilda: You know that unconditional love can still break that curse, right? 
ing2-s: Yeah ...
ing2-h: But who could ever ^love Boyle?
Grunhilda: Ha ha ha ha ha!
ing2-x: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
ing2: It feels nice to be able to have a good cackle again. 
ing2: But this wasn't the reason for my visit. That princess is cursed and it has your stench all over it. 
ing2: I don't know what you've got cooking up, nor do I care, but I need to cure the princess. 
Grunhilda: Those two were getting ^dangerously close. I had to put it on hold while I planned out my  next move. 
Grunhilda: I'm sorry, but I can't let you interfere.
ing2: Come on, Grunhilda, give it up, you hideous beast. You know this won't end well for you. 
Grunhilda: Forget it! I worked too long and hard on this for it to be taken away! 
ing2: ...
ing2-s: I feel the same way about Boyle ...
ing2: I guess you're not going to give it up. Fine. Have it your way, you miserable wretch. 
ing2: Goodbye.
Grunhilda: Nice seeing you again!
ing2-h: Likewise!
ing2: I'm taking my magic slippers back!
Grunhilda: Why don't you just use your broomstick?
ing2-a: I left it at home!
Grunhilda: You still can't fly it, can you?

Event 18: EV018
10: I love my new husband!
19: And I love my wonderful witch!
10: You are my greatest trophy!
19: And you, mine.
ing4: Well, I wasn't expecting this.
10: The time has come for me to teach you the final spell. 
sys: Ingrid learns ultimate transformation.
10: With that, you will be free to do anything you like. 
10: Anything, that is, except look at my new husband.
ing4: I'll try to keep away.

4: Oh, so you do remember me?
boy-w: You ... you betrayed me!
4: Ah ha ha ha ha! Of course I did!
5: Begone, ^demon!
4: Who is this? How did you get here?
5: I am the light in darkness. Now ^begone!
4: You can't do anything!
5: My power is infinite here, I cannot be stopped.
5: Fear not, Boyle, I've banished the apparition. This is only a dream. 
boy-s: Of course it is ... this is all I ^ever dream about. 
5: It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am Hi'beru, dream healer. 
boy-c: How did you find me?

boy: You don't have to tell ^me that.
5: I possess the power to cure your dreams, should you desire it. 
boy: I would give anything for even the slimmest of chances. 
5: From such great distance, I am powerless. You will have to find me in the real world. 
5: I wait in a secret garden in the Royal Woods. There is a secret passage in the Royal Castle. 
boy: What do you want in return?
5: Just give me the chance to help you. That's all I ask. 
5: My power is fading, you're waking up.
5: Remember, the secret passage in the castle!

6: Let's hope we're able to summon him.
6: I must warn you, I'm still very weak.
6: Boyle, I won't be able to protect you in this battle.
boy2-a: Why are you only telling ^me that!?
mys2-h: Probably because last time all you did was stand there like a lost puppy. 
boy2: I was being mind-controlled by Bahl!
6: I'm going to try the summon now ...
7: What is the meaning of this?
rob-a: We've got you now, you traitor!
7: The stable boy again, hey?
7: And my daughter ... $w.60 alive?
7: How is this possible?
6: $s.1 I won't die $w.20 until I've brought you to $w.40 justice. 
7: $s.3 You look like you're almost dead already.
7: No matter, Bahl has made me one of his captains.
7: That means I no longer need to count on silly poisons to get the job done. 
7: I will just finish you off ^right ^now!
6: $s.1 To accept such evil power so readily ...
6: What happened to you, father?
7: $s.3 I grew tired of struggling, that's all.
7: But don't worry, the struggle is almost over.
rob2: Miss Brightsword, are you ok?
6: $s.1 Heh ... I'm fine.
7: $s.3 I'd say we're even now.
6: $s.1 You're right.

6: $s.1 Oh, I'm sorry, I was only semi-conscious.
boy2-w: $s.3 You mean you didn't see me fight!?
6: $s.1 I apologize.

boy2-s: $s.1 ... fine.
6: $s.1 For now, I think I'm going to take a holiday.
rob2-h: $s.3 Where to?
6: $s.1 Someplace peaceful where I can recover.
6: $s.1 Away from the stress.
6: $s.1 But before I go, I think there's something I can teach you. 
sys: $s.3 Boyle's alertness in battle increased.
6: $s.1 Until we meet again.

Event 48: S.Marion

Event 47: S.Archie
this: Tor isn't a very friendly place, but if you do well in the arena, it becomes a ^very friendly place. 

Event 12: S.Organizer
this: I haven't seen you around here before. 
this: Must mean you want to compete in the beginners tournament. 
boy: Correct.
this: Should be an interesting one. The previous champion was knocked out in the first round. 
boy-h: You don't say?
this: By his own flail, no less. A shame, really.
this: But that's okay, there's plenty of other contenders. 
this: The quilt merchant has been causing quite a stir this season. 
this: In her last fight, she managed to get ^ten layers on a guy! 
this: Poor thing passed out from exhaustion trying to fight his way out. 
boy: There will be no such shenanigans this time.
boy: We're here to fight and the grand prize will be ours. 
this: You sound confident!
this: But so did Captain Cookie Dagger ... $w.20 poor thing crumbled to pieces in the first round.

28: Yes, that's right!
28: These boys have been literally untouchable so far. 
boy2: Untouchable, hey? That's about to change.
37: Right, guys. The mystic has gotten us this far.
37: No matter what happens, just stick to the ^plan.

boy2-c: They ... knew that was going to happen.
37: The mystic came through for us! We're going to be rich! 
12: Well, bad luck.
boy: Did they take Fang?
12: They work for the mayor. They were actually winning him for her. 
boy-w: What!? The mayor's daughter has Fang?
12: The mayor is on a trip and she's grown restless so she needs something to keep her busy. 
boy: So the mayor is not in Tor at the moment?
12: Nope.
boy: Quickly! We'll recover Fang before the mayor returns! 
12: You fought well. Feel free to move up to the next tournament level.

mys2: Don't get so hot and bothered.

33: I'll wrap this up quickly.
28: ^WOW!
28: Did a single person see ^that coming?
28: Talk about an upset! This team could go on to win it! 
28: ^HOWEVER ... they'll still have to get past one more team. 
28: And I have to say, this team has been causing quite a stir themselves. 
28: So far, their signature defense strategy hasn't yielded a single point of damage! 
28: Will Boyle and the Wonder Kin be able to crack it?
28: We'll have to find out!

this: Thank you. Please understand, I request this gold only as a deterrent. 
this: Every future scenario that I ^don't have to reveal is a greater profit to me. 
row2: Then why did you offer that guy a two-for-one deal yesterday? 
this: ... it looked like I was losing him, and my mystic powers told me he really needed to see the future.  $w.60 Twice. 
row2: Are you sure? Because that new rug tells a different story. 
this: You can't see the horrors that go on inside my mind! You don't know what I go through! 
ing-a: So you were telling us about this guard that watches the ship. 
this: Hmmm, let's see. Okay, he's going to have an accident. Let's say ... tomorrow. Yeah, tomorrow's  good. 
this: Why don't you go have a sleep at the inn and head there just after sunrise? 
this: A structural weakness will render him ineffective for a short time. 
ing: Just after sunrise? Ugh, I hate getting up early.
this: Oh, did I say just after sunrise? Sorry, the vision was cloudy ... it's actually a bit later. Around the time  you wake up. 
ing: That's perfect!
this: You won't come across predictions this accurate anywhere else. $w.30 They wear on me   terribly! 
row2: And me!
this: Quiet, you!
ing-c: What's she talking about?
this: Half the time I don't understand myself. She's not from here, you know? I rescued her. 
this: Elves are very difficult to train. Never get one.
mys-c: ^Get one?
this: Mentor! Never mentor one. Too much sass.
row2: So get a different one.
this: I went through enough to get you!
this: She has an attitude problem, as you can tell. I've been trying to fix her, but it's proving difficult. 
mys: If you can see into the future, why didn't you know you wouldn't like her? 
this: And use my powers for personal gain? I would never! 
ing: We should be going now.

row2-h: Thanks a lot, guys!

3: That's ^my apprentice! I paid GOOD MONEY for her! 
row2-x: Well, it's been an interesting experience. I unlearned a lot, but it's time to move on. 
row2: No hard feelings, all right?
ing: I guess your mystic days are over. But you could always work in our store, sweeping cobwebs. 
ing: We've got a few spiders in the attic. It's not that glamorous, but hey, it could to other things. 
3: $sp.1 You $w.30 ^fools!
3: You think I needed  ^HER to be all-knowing ... all ^powerful? 
ing: Well, yes.
3: I need ^NOBODY!
3: You haven't seen the last of me! I will have my revenge! 
3: I see ^bad ^things in your future, Miss Ingrid. ^Very bad things! 
ing-h: And what about Boyle and I? Will we still get married? 
3: I can say with ^certainty that YOU WILL NOT!
row2: Well then ... shall we leave Tor?
rob: Do you think he meant what he said about us not having seen the last of him? 
boy: Of course not. He was just keeping up appearances. 
boy: It's what I'd have done.
ing: Don't worry, Robin, I can say with certainty that this chapter in our lives is officially ^over. 
row2-h: I can't wait to put Tor behind me!

Event 11: EV011
row2: Hi guys!
3: Ahhh, you have returned. I hope seeing into the future did not cause you too much trouble. 
boy: Actually, we've come to ask for your help again. This time it will be a lot easier. 
3: Seeing into the future is ^never easy, but it is my cross to bear, so I don't complain. 
boy: We're looking for the end of the world.
boy: Do you have any idea how we might get there.
3: I'm sorry, my talents - logic defying as they may be - are limited in scope. 
3: I can barely see beyond the outskirts of Tor, let alone the ends of the earth. 
3: Simply, what you are asking me to do is impossible. 
row2-x: Hmmm, the ends of the earth ... I've heard of that place. 
row2: You can get there by going through the Windy Valley. 
boy-w: Really?
row2: Yeah.
3: That will be 500 gold!
mys-a: For what? You didn't do anything!
3: You've taken information from me. You are indebted. 
mys: But we didn't even -
3: ^Silence! $w.30 $s.1 Pay up or I will ^tell ^you ^how ^you ^die! 
boy-w: Yikes! We better pay up!
boy-s: We don't have 500 gold ...
3: Oh, you don't have it?

Event 2: EV002
ing: So ... are you this powerful mystic we've been hearing about? 
row2: Yeah, he's the one.
3: Rowen! Silence!
3: That depends. Have you come seeking insight ... or vengeance? 
ing: Both, if possible.
mys: Just insight, actually.
3: Good, never can be too sure these days.
3: Anyway!
3: So ... you wish to know what the future holds?
ing: We hear that people always get a good reading from you. 
ing: There's always a guard at the port. We need to know if and when it will be unattended. 
3: Hmmm ... so it is entrance to the port you seek.
3: Very well, I can tell you this. But first I must warn you ... 
3: The blinds of fate are not so easily parted, you see. 
3: And it is never without consequence that I am able to predict what the future holds. 
3: To be able to see  the future, before it happens, is more power than any man should truly ever have. 
3: Or ^want.
3: Before I can do this, I need to know that you understand the true cost of what it is you're asking  me to do today. 
ing: Yeah, yeah, we understand. Besides, if we don't save the world, it will hardly matter. 
3: Yes, but do you know ... the ^true cost?
ing-c: ...
boy-c: ...
mys-c: ...
row2: He wants you to pay him.
3: Rowen! Tone down that sass.
3: Don't listen to her, she's my apprentice, I've been trying to train her. 
3: But yes, I do require money.
boy: Of course.
3: The cost will be 1000 gold. Speak to me when you have it.

boy: You mean ^if your curse triggers. Face it, Ingrid, you're not the greatest witch. 
ing2: I don't care what you think. Take my offer or leave it. 
boy: ... fine. You can come with me. But this prison is heavily fortified. 
ing2: Lucky I have the key then.
boy: Where did you get ^that?
ing2: From the guard. He's taking a little nap.
boy: What was that?
ing2-w: Someone's coming! And I'm out of sleeping powder! 
ing2-w: What are we going to do?
boy: Well, you could cast a spell on them, if you knew any. 
ing2-a: Shut up!
ing2-w: I can't be seen with you! If they're ready to burn ^you at the stake, imagine what they'd do to  ^me! 
ing2-a: Arrrgghhh!
ing2-h: I did it!!!
ing2-x: My very first transformation!
boy: A frog?
ing2-h: Be grateful you're not a toad.
ing2-x: Now get in my bag!
11: What's going on here?
ing2-w: Oh ... just checking out this cell! Yeah, looks pretty good. Nice job. 
11: Carry on.
ing2: That was close. You must be restless after being locked up in there, let's find you a nice lillypad  to frolick around on. 
boy: Just do it discreetly! These people could have a taste for frog legs. 
ing2: Actually, I need some frog legs for a potion I'm working on. Would you mind ... 
boy-a: Not funny!

Event 21: U
boy: It's locked.

Event 13: EV013
boy: Has it really come to this already?
boy: I was so close ... again.
boy: Just moments ago, I was being showered with praise. 
boy: Now I'm in a strangely comforting jail cell with a dirty old rat. 
boy: Wait a minute ... that rat is my minion, Colby!
boy: Go and find the keys, Colby. The KEYS.
boy: Clever boy.
boy: It's nice having minions again.
boy-c: I wonder if those plants are real ...
boy: Colby, you're back! And you've brought the -
boy: KEYS, Colby! I said KEYS. Bring me the KEYS, okay? 
boy: Not the best minion, but you've got to start somewhere. 
boy: Back again? And what's that you've got there?
boy-s: Well, it was nice knowing you, Colby.

Event 1: S.Vampire
this: Unable to still my disdain any longer, I just up and told her; frankly, dear, your actions were   reprehensible to say the least. 
Bethany: Oh ^myyyyyyyyyy! You ^devil!
Bethany: She must have been ^mooooooortified!
this: Yes, quite. 
Bethany: Quite.
this: Quite.
boy: Who are you?
this: This is Wrymwood, correct? I believe that makes me a retired villain. 
boy: Did you know you were trapped inside this pumpkin? 
this: I vaguely remember an incident occuring ...
this: I've wanted ^so badly to escape, but frankly I've had neither the time nor the inclination to do so. 
Bethany: Oh ^myyyyyyyyyy! You ^devil!
this: I've just been so ^busy!
boy: What have you been doing?
this: Catching up with an old friend.
boy: How long have you been in here? I've never seen you in town. 
this: You know ... I can't really remember.
this: Nor do I have an inkling ^who I am, now that I think of it. 
this: What about you, Bethany? 
Bethany: Oh ^myyyyyyyyyyy!
boy: I'll see if I can find anything out. Libraries are usually filled with information about villains. 
boy: So are you going to go outside now?
this: Right after I finish catching up.

hib2: Are you excited to be back on the seas?
hib2: We'll be able to visit plenty of new places in this vessel. 
row2: You know, for the first, I actually can't wait to come back. 
row2: I think this might be my last trip.


Map 83: Windy Valley
----------------------------------------

Event 22: EV022
18: Nice job, boys. The king will be pleased.
19: Let's EAT THEM NOW!!!
18: Don't be a fool! We need to feed the king now, or he will be mad. 
20: He doesn't need to know about this!
17: I'm going to get him!
18: Dont' you dare!
19: Errr ... 
19: This is awkward. I'll leave.
boy2-c: $s.1 ... Ingrid? $s.3
ing2: Yes, Boyle?
boy2-w: Now would be a good time for one of your transformations! 
ing2: Yes.
ing2-s: But it's too cramped in this cage ... there's not enough room to cast anything. 
boy2-w: Well you better do something, because we're very close to being goblin food! 
rob2: I didn't think it would end like this.
rob2: But if it does, I just want you guys to know that it was an honor fighting beside you as equals. 
rob2: Especially you, Boyle.
rob2: You raised me with a firm hand, but always out of love, and never anger. 
rob2: You taught me what true friendship really is.
mys2-s: I must admit ... the outside world was not what I thought it would be. 
mys2-s: If I'm being honest, the only thing I would have done differently ... would be to rescue my  brother. 
ing2-s: Well, if we're going to be troll food, I may as well tell you this, Boyle. 
boy2: Tell me what?
ing2-s: The marriage curse that I put on you ...
rob2-w: Somebody is coming!
27: Wow! $w.30 Really?
mys2-w: Gimble?
19: The time has come.
19: Remove the cage!
18: What's going on here?
18: Where did this ladder come from?

Event 38: EV038
34: Uh oh, they've seen us!
34: Quickly, follow me!
34: We should be safe up here.
boy3-h: That's them dealt with!
rob3-c: Yes, but ummm ... what about the king?
boy3: Ha! Their king wasn't so tough after all!
34: Actually, he's not the king anymore.
34: ^That is the king.
boy3-w: Yikes!
rob3-w: What's he going to do with that?
34: I have a theory, but I hope it's wrong ...
boy3-w: What do we do!?
34: I guess he didn't think that one completely through. 
boy3: Where has he gone?
34: He's a smart one. Probably lying in wait somewhere. 
34: I doubt you've seen the last of him.
mys3-h: Thank you for saving me ... again.
34: Don't mention it. You'll pay me back someday.
34: Of that I am certain.

Event 63: EV063
mys: Should we wait outside again?
ing: No. I don't want to be left alone with her.
boy-w: She must be horrible!
ing: Worse than you can imagine.

Event 3: EV003
4: We won't catch ^anything in that cage?
4: Nobody could possibly be ^that stupid? 
4: To stand right where we wanted them to, just because of a big cross? 
16: Alright, alright, I was wrong. What do you want from  me? 
16: Come on, stop wasting time! We have to get these guys back. 
16: If the king doesn't get his dinner soon, he's going to start eating ^us! 

Event 70: EV070
x-boy: Hey Ingrid, that house looks exactly like yours.
x-ing-a: It looks nothing like it!
x-boy: Should we see what's inside?
x-ing-a: Absolutely not. There's no need.

Event 62: U.Squirrel King

this: One day, we will unleash our master plan and rule the world! 

Event 51: U
mys-h: Got it!

Event 58: EV058
mys: I'm pretty sure the list will be inside the castle.

Event 19: EV019
rob3: And that was the most yoghurt I ever ate.
1: Fascinating ...
mys3: Come on Robin, time to go.
mys3: I got you a present.
rob3-h: The list of warriors! Boyle is going to be so impressed with you! 
mys3-h: Let's tell him you found it.
rob3: Really? You'd let me take credit for this?
mys3-h: I think Boyle already likes me enough.
rob3: Thanks so much. I'll make it up to you!

Event 9: EV009
boy2: Here she is. Well, go ahead and fix her.
ing2: I can't.
boy2-w: What do you mean you can't!?
ing2: I didn't curse her. Why would I have the cure?
boy2-w: What!? What are we supposed to do then?
ing2: You tell  me. You're the one who volunteered to fix her. 
boy2-a: Why didn't you stop me if you couldn't do anything? 
ing2-h: I can turn her into a frog if you like.
boy2: Would that wake her up?
ing2: No ... do you know anything about curses?
boy2-w: Myst? Do you have any ideas?
mys2: ...
mys2: I could envelop her in mist ...
boy2-c: And would that help?
mys2-h: No. Hee hee.
ing2-h: I'm starting to like you.
boy2-a: This isn't funny. Our necks are on the line here. 
boy2: You'll be going straight to the gallows if we fail this. 
ing2-h: I'd like to see them try.
ing2: Fine, your desperation is starting to annoy me.  
ing2: I need you to retain ^some credibility if you're going to be my husband one day. 
ing2: This looks like the work of my sister. She lives in these parts, after all.  
ing2: She simply needs to be kissed by her paladin lover and she'll wake up. 
Guard: That could be a problem. Her prince charming  went missing two weeks ago. Nobody has seen him  since. 
ing2: And how long has she been cursed for?
Guard: Two weeks ...
ing2: If my sister cast the curse like I think, she'll know the whereabouts of the prince. 
ing2: She lives in the North Royal Woods.

Event 61: U.Banana Boy
this: I'm back where I belong.

Event 1: S.King
boy4: Hello Your Majesty.
this: For the last time, I said ^no ^visitors!
boy4: But we brought you a very elegant frame from the market. 
this: My daughter is in peril! She could die!
this: Do you really think my attention could be taken by shiny objects at a time like this? 
this: ...
this: Fine, let me see it ...
this: ...
this: Okay ... it's pretty nice. I will hear what you have to say. 
this: But understand I'm very distraught! My daughter is the most important thing in the world to me, and I  will not - 
this: ^Hey! That's a nice necklace you've got there.
mys4-h: Oh, thank you very much!
this: Are you looking to sell it?
mys4-s: I'm sorry, I can't part with it ...
this: Ahhh, sentimental value, hey? I understand. I have this really nice rose girdle ... 
ing4: So you were saying something about your daughter! 
this: My what? $w.30 Oh, yes, of course. My prized possession. My life. My everything. She is all I have  in this world.  
this: She has been ... oh, I can't even say it -
this: That ^is a very nice ring you've got there ...
this: ^CURSED! $w.25 My own daughter! From  morning til night, I think of nothing but her. 
this: I am not fit to serve as king so long as she is like this! 
this: I am in such a state of despair, I've even considered stepping down just so I may spend more  time looking for a cure! 
this: The worst part of it ... there is something I wanted to say to her, but never got the chance. 
this: If I could just speak to her ... even for asecond ... I could move on. 
mys4: How touching. You love her as you would a four-legs. 
this: How ^dare you!?
ing4-x: Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
ing4: Careful, Myst, not everybody loves their pets as much as Boyle. 
this: I cannot bear the pain any longer! I live every day with regret at not saying what I wanted to say  sooner. 
boy4: We have a witch here who specializes in curses. Perhaps she could help ... 
this: A ^what!? You mean to tell me I have allowed a witch in ^my keep? 
this: I don't know whether to smite you or kiss you!
ing4-a: I don't recommend either.
this: You're in luck. On any other day, I'd have sent you off to the gallows by now. 
this: But if you can cure my daughter, I may offer you a repreive. 
ing4: How generous of you.
boy4: We don't work for free. If we do this for you, we want a boat. 
this: A boat for my daughter's life? That's ^unreasonable!  
this: But I'll arrange for you to be dropped off anywhere you like. 
boy4: That will have to do.
this: She's upstairs somewhere if you'd like to take a look at her. I never can seem to remember which  room is hers. 
this: She's upstairs somewhere if you'd like to take a look at her. I never can seem to remember which  room is hers. 
this: Do you come bearing news of my daughter?
ing: Indeed, we've discovered the way to fix her, but we require a paladin. 
this: A paladin ... this could prove troublesome.
ing: You're the king. I figured you would have plenty at your disposal. 
this: Normally ... yes. But they're preparing for a crusade at the moment.  
this: I can't really pull them back. What would that look like? 
ing-a: Your daughter's life is at risk!
this: I'm sure you'll fix her. Unless you'd rather go to the gallows? 
this: I know what I'd choose.
ing: I guess we'll have to go and get one ourselves.
boy-w: An entire army of paladins? I think we should steer clear of that. 
ing: It'll be okay, Boyle. We only need one. You're not scared, are you? 
boy-a: Of course not!
mys: How will we convince him to help us?
boy-h: Don't worry, I've got an idea ...
boy: Let's head to the camp, I'll tell you when we get there. 
this: Do you come bearing news of my daughter?
this: Betrayed by my own daughter. What kind of a king am I? 
ing: An obnoxious one.
boy: So, as for our reward ...
this: Oh, of course. I hereby grant you free access to the trade ships that travel between here and Tor. 
mys: That's handy!
boy-a: We don't need to travel to Tor! We need to travel to the Shadow Lands. 
this: I'm not sending my trade ships there! That's crazy talk. 
boy-a: We had a deal!
this: You know what ...
this: The paladins are planning a crusade on the Shadaow Lands. If you really want to go, why don't  you sign up? 
boy-a: You want me to team up with those bloodthirsty devils? You've lost your mind! We will  not! 
ing: Boyle, that's actually not a bad idea. It's a free trip to the Shadow Isles. 
boy: I doubt we'd even make it there with those cretins helming the ship. 
boy: We'd be tossed overboard before we even left the port. 
ing: We have the king's approval. They won't do anything to us. 
rob: Do you mind if I come along? It's kind of my dream to join a crusade. 
boy-a: Absolutely not. We're done with you.
rob: Okay, maybe some other time.
mys-a: Hold it!
mys-c: This boy is different than the others.
mys: He possesses a strange purity I've yet to identify elsewhere. 
boy: I knew there was a reason I didn't like him.
mys: I want him to come with us.
ing-h: If it causes Boyle more grief, I'm all for it.
mys-h: Oh yes, I hadn't even considered that!
rob-a: Perfect! Let's go join that crusade!
rob-h: I've always wanted a real reason to say that!
this: ^Hold ^it!
this: One more thing ...
this: How much for your witch?
ing-a: Excuse me?
this: She really is quite amazing ... I'd like to buy her.
this: She will be my most prized possession!!!
this: I will place her in my trophy room alongisde my golden chalice! 
boy: I'm going to have to stop you there. Not because I don't want to be rid of her - of course I do. 
boy: Sadly she has to help me save the world.
this: Let the world burn, I say! With her at my side, I would be unstoppable! All would fear me! 
this: Don't worry, I will offer you a fair reward. How does a silk mattress sound? 
boy: Like more than she is worth ...
boy: But sadly I cannot make the deal.
ing-a: Gee, thanks for sticking up for me, future husband! 
this: Betrayed by my own daughter. What kind of a king am I? 
this: I am thankful you have returned safely.
rob: I would pay any price to protect this- $end
this: I was talking to the witch!
this: Are you ready to enter my trophy room yet?
boy: She's still saving the world.
this: Are you ready to enter my trophy room yet?
this: There's my wonderful witch!
this: Never have I seen you smiling so.
this: I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.
this: I've given father's treasured items away to the poor people. 

Event 12: EV012
1: Ahhh, you've returned!
1: But ... where is that most enchanting enchantress? 
rob3: She's hiding outside. I think she's scared of you. 
1: She has nothing to fear in here. The pedestal I will place her on is most inviting. 
1: So, to what do I owe the pleasure?
rob3-c: Good question ... I think we wanted to register something. 
1: Register $w.30 ^something?
rob3-c: No ... that's not right.
rob3-s: Argh! I did it again. I got so caught up in my excitement that I stopped listening. 
mys3: Shall we go and ask again?
rob3-s: If we do that I'll never earn Boyle's respect.
rob3: Look, we're trying to recruit some warriors for the crusade. 
1: Ah, so you probably want to see my list of registered fighters. 
rob3-h: Yes, that's it! Do you have one?
1: Wouldn't be much of a king if I didn't. But why should I give it to you? 
rob3-a: Because $w.30 we're on a crusade!!
1: Crusades are very bad for a king. I stand to lose a lot of good men.  
1: The only point in supporting them is to keep up appearances. 
rob3-w: What about glory? 
rob3-h: Pride?
rob3-a: Vengeance?
rob3-x: Integrity?
1: Worthless.
rob3-s: Come on, my reputation is riding on this!
mys3: Robin ... a word?
mys: He's not going to give it up.
mys-h: We need a new plan ...
rob: ...
rob-h: Shall we kidnap him?
mys-w: There are a lot of guards around. 
mys: Robin, I have an idea. Can you stay here and keep him distracted for a while? 
rob: Sure, what are you going to do?
mys-h: Don't you worry!
mys: Just keep him distracted.
mys: Now ... where is he keeping that list?

Event 11: EV011
boy2: All right, Robin. You're up.
rob2: Forgive me princess, but I'm doing this for you.
rob2-w: She's awake!
rob2-h: I'm a real paladin!
18: My daughter! You are awake once more!
4: Father ... is that you?
18: My daughter, I have waited too long to speak these words to you! 
18: ^No ^more! From now on, I will speak my feelings!
4: Hold nothing back, father, I have waited long to hear your true feelings. 
18: Where did you put my lavish robe? I've been looking for it everywhere! 
4: ^That is what you wanted of me?
18: I have thought of nothing else for the past twenty nights while you were cursed! 
18: I've been worried sick!
18: That robe means everything to me.
18: Speak quickly, lest you fall back into another deep sleep and take the location of the robe with you! 
4: I ^cannot believe you!
4: $s.2 You are the $s.1 WORST $s.2 father ever! $s.3 
18: $s.3 I don't have time for your tantrums, Jewel.
18: We may not have long together, let's make the seconds we do have count. 
4: Fine, I'll tell you where the robe is! I gave it to my ^boyfriend! 
4: Speaking of which, where is that man? Why didn't ^he wake me from my curse? 
18: Because you drove him to madness with that attitude of yours!  
18: He'd rather be a frog than put up with you any longer, and I can't say I blame him! 
18: Now you have no need for the robe, so give it back! 
4: If you didn't want to lose it, you never should have challenged me to two-card flip! 
18: I shouldn't have had to! Your mother's scarf should have been mine to begin with! 
18: That ^does it! *I'm *not *talking *to *you *anymore!!!
4: FINE! I'm not talking to ^you anymore either!
4: Tell me ... is it true what my father says? Is my beloved a frog? 
rob2-s: I'm sorry. I'm sure you'll find somebody else.
4: ^No!
4: I'm not ready to give up yet. I've already invested too much time and effort into him! 
4: I gave him my father's ^favorite robe!
4: I had him kicked out of the crusade.
4: I had his betrothed shipped off to Tor under false pretenses ... 
4: I even had him spend three weeks in ^the ^dungeon! 
4: I won't lie here and see all of my efforts ^wasted!
rob2-c: Perhaps if I kidnapped him for you ...
4: Yes!
4: And I'll pretend to be asleep.
4: When he gets here, we'll do the whole thing again!
boy2: I want no part in this.
ing2: It's sweet!
boy2: No man should be forced to marry against his will. 
ing2: That's just the curse talking.
4: My father is very wealthy, and not great at protecting his assets. Perhaps we can work  something out. 
boy2: Maybe ...
boy2: For now, I'd like to speak to the king again. He owes us a boat. 

Event 60: S.Rodgar
this: I'm all out of jokes.
this: Welcome to the courtyard.
this: I'm the king's personal jester!
ing: Tell us a joke!
this: Okay.
this: Here's a good one.
this: How much does a king's jester get paid?
ing: How much?
this: Nothing!
ing-c: What?
this: I know, what a joke!
sys: Found king's courtyard!
rob: We'd like to enter the squirrel base.
z-this: I haven't a clue what you're talking about!
t-this: Come back at night, kid.
rob: We'd like to enter the squirrel base.
this: Friends of the leader, hey?
this: Alright, come on in.

Event 3: S.Guard2
this: The princess is not fit for visitors at this time.

Event 21: EV021
mys5: This must be where he keeps the list.

Event 10: EV010
boy2: Okay, Robin. As you can see, the princess has been cursed. 
boy2: A kiss from a paladin will wake her up, so have at it. 
rob2: Ummm ...
rob2-c: Are we sure that's a good idea? I mean, have you considered any alternatives? 
boy2: Yes, we already tried them. What's the problem? 
rob2-w: I mean ... well, ummm, it's too forward, don't you think? 
boy2: I'm sure she'll forgive you, given the circumstances. 
rob2: Okay, I guess. Here goes ...
boy2-c: Is she awake?
ing2: Nope.
boy2-a: Try again!
ing2: Still not working.
rob2: Okay, one more try.
ing2: That's enough. It's clearly not working.
boy2: It makes no sense. We brought a paladin!
boy2-c: Robin?
rob2-w: ...eh?
boy2-a: You ^are a paladin, right?
rob2-w: Heh ... sort of ...
rob2: I may not be a paladin, but I act like one!
rob2: I'm courteous.
rob2: I'm punctual.
rob2: I'm $end
boy2-a: So you lied to me!? After I spent all that time and energy kidnapping you? 
rob2-w: No! I'm so sorry! It wasn't a waste! I promise!
rob2-s: It's just ... I thought we'd start with doing a few deliveries or something. 
rob2-s: How was I supposed to know we'd start with this? 
boy2: You've failed as a paladin, and worse, you've failed as a minion. 
boy2: Now we have to go and kidnap another one. 
ing2: Hold it.
ing2: Boyle, I think I might have an idea.
ing2: Robin, allow us to talk in private for a moment.
rob2: Okay. Just promise you won't go anywhere without me. 
ing2: He's not a paladin, but  all may not yet be lost.
ing2: He only has to ^think he's a paladin for this to work. So all we have to do is convince him. 
mys2: It seems a poor idea to convince him that he is something he's not. 
ing2: Somebody convinced you that you weren't annoying. 
ing2: Besides, it helps us right now, and that's the most important thing. 
ing2: All we have to do is  make a fake trial for him. 
ing2: We'll take him into the cave near my sister's house, then I'll conjure a fake spirit. 
ing2: When he defeats it, he'll think he's a paladin.
boy2: It sounds good to me, but so has everything else up until this point. 
ing2: The main requirement is that the subject is open to suggestion. In that regard, we've hit the jackpot. 
boy2: I think you're forgetting one thing.
ing2: And what is that?
boy2: You're a lousy witch. You can't conjure a spirit. 
ing2-a: ^Excuse me!? $w.30 My knowledge and curses are the only thing that have gotten us ^this  far! 
boy2: I was just going to suggest we use a summoning scroll. 
boy2: I've seen a few scary types around this town. This would be the place to get one. 
ing2: ...
ing2: Send Robin back in.
ing2: Good news, Robin. We're going to give you the chance to become a real paladin. 
ing2: But you'll need to pass a very difficult trial first. Think you're up to it? 
rob2-h: You bet!
ing2: Great. Then let us head to the cleansing caves.

Event 57: EV057
mys: Good, Robin is keeping him occupied.

Event 53: U.SecretDungeon
boy-c: Why is this piece of wall framed with a doorway? 
ing: Who knows? Maybe there used to be a door there. 
boy: Yes ... ^used to.
boy: This wall is very out of place. Let's see what happens when I touch it ... 
boy-h: I knew it!
mys: Nothing suspicious here.

Event 2: S.Guard

Event 64: S.Druid2
this: Come see me when you've destroyed all the scarecrows. 
boy: We're done.
boy: The scarecrows were no challenge for me and my powers. 
this: I'm impressed.
this: You're a brave man to complete such a task.
this: The very thought of going ^near a scarecrow is enough to give me nightmares.
